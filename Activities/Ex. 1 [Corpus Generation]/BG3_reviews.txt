Its DnD for people with no friends
Karlach
This game ruined my life
Im not any fancy reviewer however I am a gamer and consumer like the rest of you kindly requesting you offer a few minutes to hear what I have to share
Let me start being brief Larian Studios has blown me away

For some context of who I am and where I come from I have loved the divinity games for a few years now and was hyped for them being announced to make the successor to Balldurs Gate I  II 
I am a also a Gamemaster and have been for Dungeons  Dragons nearly fourteen years now Ive been in the DnD sphere of games and RPGs since the beginnings of 2nd Edition when I was really young I have experienced each system across the board numerous titles accompanying the array of editions published 

To speak of BG III itself What Larian did here not only blew away my expectations as a DD experience but honored many of the greatest markers of DD and RPG and CRPG history that can be found as DD has evolved over its many years What Larian has done is created the perfect gateway into Baldurs gate and older classics with the fervor and easy accessibility of 5th edition DD 

Baldurs Gate III has done the impossible this is the perfect place to begin if you never played DD and would like to feel what its like or if you just cannot access a DD group and still would like to play BG III utilizes the best parts of the game system and highlights them with an exemplary immersive experience that showcases many old classics that came before in the same curated heart and care in their creation years ago
Even still it rests at a comfortable price with an innumerable amounts of replayability at your fingertips with one price tag No microtransactions no subscriptions no catches BG III was made for you and I both fans and gamers each A true testaments to the games that came before and were adored for the respect and care for not only the game but those who are playing their game 

Larian Studios have been folk I have chosen to watch closely a while now and I have zero hesitancy today they are one of the developers to keep even closer eyes on They are a relic of Gaming seemingly lost and excruciating difficult to find in the western markets today and they have my full adoration and respect

Baldurs Gate III is in a very small and shrinking category each passing year One of the few games released in recent years I found worth my time and money as it was a full packaged deal that truly captivate me and have me inspired with hope to finally sit down and enjoy where the sky is the limit
This is a friend for scratch Friends who pass by can pet it and give it a thumbs up

Astarion rocks
It was an honor to finally meet Baldur The one that built the gate
I havent finished it yet and I dont expect to finish it any time soon Act 1 took me about 50 hours Act 2 is supposed to be 1020 hours longer and I havent even got to Act 3 yet

Its the best game Ive played in a long time Best single player RPG since Dragonage Origins Also supports multiplayer which works quite well

It has an amazing cast of voice actors The core companions are really wellwritten and all have their quests to explore many of which are linked to the main story

Gameplay is really engaging You can save freely whenever you want even midconversation

Its based on the DD 5 ruleset but they made some necessary changes like no prestidigitation spell

One thing to be aware of  Long Resting A bunch of cutscenes that advance the story will happen in the camp when you rest For this reason I suggest resting quite often You can also go to the camp and end the day without taking a long rest to get the story stuff
I will leave this cat here so that everybody who passes by can pet it and give it a thumbs up and awards

dd but you dont need friends and everyone is extremely horny
She baldur on my gate
For the one or two hours I played it seemed a nice game
My play time should tell you everything you need to know
I played a bit of early access a year ago or so So when I started playing this game in full release I already knew it was going to be pretty good But the full release was far better than my own expectations This already is most likely one of my favourite games and I have yet to explore other possibilities ingame 

The finale of every act feels so rewarding after all your efforts The details in every zone are amazing i found myself exploring every single room and corner of the world and collecting books notes and other papers full of lore 

My favourite Act was definitely Act III but not to say Act I and II were bad It was because of the previous Acts that Act III made sense and felt so satisfying 

My favourite arc if you can call it that was House of Hope or Raphaels arc Im sure most of the players agree they enjoyed his song during his boss fight This poetic devil named Raphael is one my favourite characters I think he and Mizora truly represent what we know of devils Nice detail on 666HP Hope was also cool wholesome and funny How am I not gonna save her during my evil run

My favourite companion is predictable I know but yes Shadowheart and I am not talking about romance only Every character really developed during the story and trying to solve their own personal problems while fighting together to solve their common problem the illithid tadpoles stuck in their brains and saving the world from the Absolute or not depending on your choices Most characters even NPCs have a story a personality a opinion of their own So sometimes if you are making certain decisions you might not just be affecting the main or secondary characters but also a random NPC walking by

Cinematics were amazing and well planned I used screenshot a lot
I hope the voice actors of this game were payed good The characters felt so real with their emotions and personalities The team who worked on expressions and body language helped a lot to give the characters life of course

A few extras I feel the need to say
Shadow isles was the hardest part imo It did indeed felt how hard it was to live in those conditions and the amount of destruction in the various places of the map caused by the curse But again all that to satisfyingly reward us with a lot
Karlachs ending made me want to cry no matter the ending you chose cry from sadness relief or joy
Im not sure if I missed stuff in the previous Acts but Act III felt the longest one It was probably intended

I think thats all Thanks for reading and for the patience
Sorry if bad english
Baldurs Gate 3 is a magnificent journey that immerses players in a world of magic mystery and mayhem From the very beginning the game captures your attention with its stunning visuals engaging storytelling and intricate character development Larian Studios has truly outdone themselves in creating an experience that pays homage to the beloved Baldurs Gate series while introducing fresh and innovative gameplay mechanics

The first two acts of the game are nothing short of brilliant The attention to detail in the environments the diverse array of characters and the complex narrative choices make for a truly unforgettable experience The combat system is both strategic and dynamic offering a perfect blend of classic RPG elements and modern gameplay

The character creation and progression system in Baldurs Gate 3 are exceptional allowing players to mold their characters into unique personalities with their own strengths weaknesses and backstories The companions you encounter throughout your journey are wellwritten and add depth to the overall narrative with each having their own quirks and motivations

However where Baldurs Gate 3 falters is in its final act The journey to the climax is nothing short of spectacular but as the story reaches its pinnacle the experience becomes marred by a noticeable lack of polish Quests become less refined and the overall level of detail in both the narrative and the environment seems to take a hit

While the final act still manages to deliver a satisfying conclusion to the overarching story the lack of polish is undeniable Some plotlines feel rushed and there are instances where the games performance dips breaking the otherwise immersive experience Its disappointing to see such a fantastic journey conclude with a slightly tarnished finale

Despite these shortcomings Baldurs Gate 3 remains a mustplay for any RPG enthusiast The majority of the game is a testament to Larian Studios dedication to quality and the final act although unpolished doesnt diminish the overall enjoyment of the game With the promise of updates and improvements theres hope that the developers will address these issues ensuring that Baldurs Gate 3 stands as a shining example of modern RPG excellence
I tried my best to get into the spirit of this game but I just couldnt Its obvious that Larian Studios went above and beyond normal efforts on this game and I was very much into the concept of virtually go anywhere and do anything and play it your way but its just not my thing I didnt really feel invested in the story or the characters I did meet the combat was a bit too slow for my tastes even though I fully understand its a turn based game and I overall just didnt have any desire to keep going You may feel differently and if you do Im sure youll have fun with it I just didnt
h1Prefaceh1
TLDR Baldurs Gate is a game made by a talented passiondriven team and deserves its Overwhelmingly Positive score However it is not for everyone Consider this a Mixed review

h1Is this for youh1
For context I am a huge fan of tactical strategy games turn based RPGs CRPGs and narrative heavy games I have all that qualities of someone who should love this game at least in theory

In my eyes its not quite Baldurs Gate enough to be considered a natural continuation of the franchise Simultaneously its not freeform enough to be considered Divinity Original Sin 3 Its like an awkward mixture of both with modified DnD 5e rules thrown in In some areas it works quite well but the vast majority of the fusion feels halfbaked

My theory is that the high score comes from three camps
list
 People who have never played the Divinity Franchise and like DnD
 Larian super fans
 Gamers who are starved for good games by the lack of new good quality AAA titles and general bad business practices from them
list


If youre like me on the other hand I dont typically lean on AAA titles to maximize my enjoyment out of gaming I have played previous Larian games before and this doesnt come off as much different than their previous entry Divinity Original Sin 2

h1I heard you like dice rollsh1
Lets talk about the most obvious lowhanging fruit The dice roll mechanic The implementation of the mechanic is oversaturated You roll for most things even if youre adept at whatever skill you are trying to check for This trivializes the entire mechanic and also shows a lack of fundamental understanding of why you even roll dice on skill checks in the first place You typically roll for things that are bnotb part of your characters core skills unless the particular check is more difficult than average or it presents a clear and present dangerimportance to the party 

Instead there are a ton of 10 or under level skill checks thrown in on most things especially locks If you are playing with a rogue or bring Astarion you are going to succeed on the vast majority of these unlocks It seems as if the simple solution is to bypass the check for rolls if you have modifiers that would only cause failure in the case of a 1 That would at least take out 80 of the cruft associated with trivial rolls

On the same token lets talk about more difficult rolls and their underwhelming results Most of these more difficult rolls are for dialogue options and these are difficult even if you have proficiency in them Only rarely have I had a difficult check result in something that changed the outcome of a predetermined event but it is inexcusable to not have ALL incredibly difficult checks result in some kind of a boon to the player if they succeed Using two examples Theres an intimidation check you can succeed for one of the boss encounters in Act 2 When you succeed that the leader convinces his followers to kill themselves This feels awesome and makes the coming fight much easier In the same Act you fight another boss in which you have to succeed two difficult checks in a row The last one is nearly impossible to get without tons of extra modifiers or a perfect 20 If you do succeed you get more dialogue and no changes to the fight whatsoever All this does is punish players who want to get the most out of the story by leaving certain outcomes gated by luck

h1The Rest is historyh1
I understand what they were trying to do with short rests and long rests but it could have been implemented in a way that makes sense to both game flow and 5e rules

The core problem is this The combat system encourages you to go into encounters be sparing with some of your more powerful abilities and spells until you really need them and do softresets by short resting so you can be ready for more encounters before you have to inevitably return to camp This can work in theory but there are a two major factors working against this system

Firstly there arent a lot of trivial encounters in the game While there are definitely some the vast majority of combat encounters have lots of enemies characters getting bursted down to critically low health or require you to dip into some of your limited abilities to be efficient While you can just short rest and continue you severely reduce your likelihood of success if your characters are at lowmid health for the next encounter I did try to limit long resting as much as possible but then realized that there wasnt much point in doing that as you end up drowning in camping supplies the more you progress Short resting was a simple push your luck and continue option

Second healing is almost pointless in this game outside of resting Some of your stronger heals even when upcasting them tend to barely restore the HP of the character youre targeting Its far better to use the limited spell slots for a more offensiveutility driven spell Even the group party heal you get out of combat sucks I did find one potential use for healing though I admit Ive never played a healing character in DnD and didnt know this was legal and thats bringing up a character that is down performing saving throws My thought was that they can only be healed if brought up from that downed state by using the help action Turns out I was using my heals incorrectly the vast majority of my play through Ah well

h1Play the story strikeyoustrike I want to play or elseh1
This is a personal gripe and Im sure different characters will yield different results but I want to say that I played Gale the way I thought his story should play out I did not know that by doing so spoilerit would prematurely end my gamespoiler and despite the sortof resolution it was unsatisfying But what was even more unsatisfying was that in order to continue I had to replay that scene and just pretend that Gale had different motivations It begs the question why even present that as a choice to the player while also giving tidbits into his background and personal motivations just to punish the player by following through with it Im not expecting a narrative epic with thousands of branching pathways depending on responses but it seems like a design oversight Maybe its just an example of Larian humor but it removed a lot of my motivation to continue

Whats worse your own characters motivations as your approach act 3 become so disjointed with the story up until that point it makes me wish I accepted what I got early and stopped there It seems to be typical with Larian that the story starts strong and ends up significantly weaker the further you go on It happened with Divinity Original Sin 2 and Im not shocked its here as well


h1Positivesh1
Thats a whole lot of negatives so why am I claiming this a mixed review instead of a outright negative one

Despite this game not being for me it is very clearly made with love for a specific audience in mind Most of my criticism are not game breaking and depending on your character selections you may not even encounter the problems I did Still you dont need my review to convince you There are clearly a vast majority of gamers who did enjoy their experiences Im only offering my perspective to sway those who may be on the fence

Allinall using the combat system as an analogy You have advantage on a 93 chance of liking this game Probability says you will like this game but dont be surprised if its a miss for you Thats just how things play out sometimes

iShould mention that the original review went more indepth into some areas and had to be cut to meet the current text character restriction Comments are open for further discoursei
its cheaper than a heroin addiction
There is virtually nothing of value left to be said about Baldurs Gate 3 Its an ambitious title that faithfully captures the lightninginabottle effect that the original had on the industry in 98 while elevating the CRPG genre to greater heights 

In the interests of saying something new I will review its platforming With the recent Patch 5 most of the jumping issues have been fixed though questionable pathfinding still occurs on occasion On the platforming scale of Dark Souls to Super Mario Odyssey Baldurs Gate 3 gets an above average grade
So yes its amazing just get it if you enjoy Fantasy RPGs
But best game ever
Right so Im not going to sing its praises as everyone else has done this job
I am going to list how it could have been better and why its maybe not the best game ever Because I can
1 Level Cap Limitations Yes Ive read the guff online of people defending the limit of 12 but they could easily have allowed you to level up to 1516 without ruining the enjoyment of the game Once you are in act 3 and you hit 12 you still have loads to do Although I found most fights fun at 12 a few more levels would have stopped me having to do a bit of cheese and this was only on balanced mode mind If there are certain overpowered spells remove or nerf them They have basically done this already anyway Dispel Magic anyone
2 Inventory and Storage system Its such a faff yes Ive seen worse but Ive also seen better One chest for storage in your camp with limited sort options No stacking of the same items so many dagger slots
3 The Aggro is too random In the Goblin camp you get into it with one group Every Goblin in the world turns on you In a prison you break someone out kill all the guards and you are flirting with their colleagues at the top of the stairs whilst the escaped prisoner is stood next to you As the Goblin Camp is your first experience It restricts experimentation as you try and avoid combat in situations that are valid options as you expect every man and their dog to turn on you
4 Its too woke Only joking I thought it was fine you snowflakes
This Game has taken over my life I am thinking about Baldurs gate when I am at work I am thinking about Baldurs gate when I am sleeping I am thinking about Baldurs gate when I am playing Baldurs gate
