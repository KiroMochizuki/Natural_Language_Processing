I have loved the divinity games for a few years now and was hyped for them being announced to make the successor to Balldur's Gate I & II. \nI am a also a Gamemaster and have been for Dungeons & Dragons nearly fourteen years now. I've been in the DnD sphere of games and RPGs since the beginnings of 2nd Edition when I was really young. I have experienced each system across the board, numerous titles accompanying the array of editions published. \n\nTo speak of BG III itself; What Larian did here not only blew away my expectations as a D&D experience, but honored many of the greatest markers of D&D and RPG (and CRPG) history that can be found as D&D has evolved over its many years. What Larian has done is created the perfect gateway into Baldur's gate and older classics with the fervor and easy accessibility of 5th edition D&D. \n\nBaldur's Gate III has done the impossible, this is the perfect place to begin if you never played D&D and would like to feel what its like or if you just cannot access a D&D group and still would like to play. BG III utilizes the best parts of the game system and highlights them with an exemplary immersive experience that showcases many old classics that came before in the same curated heart and care in their creation years ago.\nEven still, it rests at a comfortable price with an innumerable amounts of replay-ability at your fingertips with one price tag. No micro-transactions, no subscriptions, no catches. BG III was made for you and I; both fans and gamers each. A true testaments to the games that came before and were adored for the respect and care for not only the game, but those who are playing their game. \n\nLarian Studios have been folk I have chosen to watch closely a while now, and I have zero hesitancy today they are one of the developers to keep even closer eyes on. They are a relic of Gaming seemingly lost and excruciating difficult to find in the western markets today, and they have my full adoration and respect.\n\nBaldur's Gate III is in a very small and shrinking category each passing year. One of the few games released in recent years I found worth my time and money as it was a full packaged deal that truly captivate me and have me inspired with hope to finally sit down and enjoy where the sky is the limit.", "timestamp_created": 1705706703, "timestamp_updated": 1705708633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 126, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.861697077751159668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157141646": {"recommendationid": "157141646", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009215920", "num_games_owned": 1405, "num_reviews": 120, "playtime_forever": 2811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1324, "playtime_at_review": 1486, "last_played": 1707155585}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a friend for scratch.

[/i] [/h1]\n\n[h2] Roleplaying Elements [/h2]\nThere have been many great games that truly put you in the driver\u2019s seat without relying on the illusion of control, but Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 has managed to surprise me in this matter. Almost every action you take has consequences. Sometimes, the order of your actions might determine the future as well. This extremely enhances the replayability. The game rewards thoughtful actions and truly allows for role-playing, a term that is sadly misused in many modern games.\n\n[h2] Gameplay [/h2]\nThe overall gameplay is super rewarding because you constantly see the outcomes of your actions, both in and out of combat. Plus, a great build variety that offers tons of fun as heck experimenting and replayability.\n\n[h2] Voice acting and dialogue [/h2]\nSimply marvelous. Every single voice actor did such an amazing job that you can immediately tell each and every one of them did what they did with great passion. Each line of dialogue flows effortlessly, thanks to the amazing writing.\n\n[h2] Story and characters [/h2]\nEven though the dialogue is great, the story is one of the weakest parts of Baldur\u2019s Gate 3. It doesn\u2019t hurt the overall quality of the game; however, it is quite clich\u00e9d. Nevertheless, combined with a diverse and compelling cast of characters and deep roleplaying mechanics, the story is overall interesting and worthwhile.\n\n[h2] Sound & Music [/h2]\nA soundtrack that will surely stick with me for the rest of my life. Hearing \u201cDown by the River\u201d for the first time in character creation and \u201cSong of Balduran\u201d in Act 3 have become some of my favorite moments in gaming. Going back to camp after a hard-fought battle and hearing all these fantastic songs while chatting with your companions\u2014now that is indeed special.\n\n[h2] UI/UX [/h2]\nPretty concise UI that is easy to comprehend and navigate. It is particularly important in a game like this, so I think it is worth mentioning.\n\n[h2] CO-OP experience [/h2]\nWe played the game 2-player coop, and I gotta say, it was easily the best multiplayer experience I\u2019ve ever had. Super smooth coop interactions and no \u201chost-guest complications\u201d like in many other games. It was a blast debating which dialogue options to go with, who to side with, who to betray, and so on. It truly was a special experience in that regard.\n\n[h2] Bugs [/h2]\nA game as big as this naturally has bugs. Acts 1 and 2 were almost perfect; however, Act 3 annoyed me a bit with the bugs. Bugs such as some cutscenes not loading, some enemies not taking any actions, visual inconsistencies, etc. Bugs in Act 3 are worth mentioning, even though they are not game-breaking and didn\u2019t really affect my enjoyment.\n\n[h2] Final thoughts [/h2]\nIn my 17 years of gaming, I have only had a few experiences that are comparable to Baldur\u2019s Gate 3. I am truly grateful that I got to experience a masterpiece of this caliber.", "timestamp_created": 1705470525, "timestamp_updated": 1705530319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629366278648376465", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156505567": {"recommendationid": "156505567", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987760011", "num_games_owned": 649, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 11015, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2243, "playtime_at_review": 7467, "last_played": 1707619671}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't finished it yet, and I don't expect to finish it any time soon.

Almost every time I kill an enemy it zooms in on their corpse. I know people are lusting after goblin women, but I don't want to have goblin rear fill my entire screen 20+ seconds every time I kill one. \n\nPeople complained about Mass Effect 3's endings and yet praise this game even though the endings are worse. You pick control or destroy. Nothing you do matters. You can go full scorched earth and slaughter every person you meet then pick the destroy ending and you're a hero. Oh by the way, it took five entire months to add in a post-game aftermath party as a half-arsed solution to the fact they didn't even bother adding in an end of game slideshow like Divinity Original Sin 2.\n\nPeople complained about multiple RPGs not giving you any actual choices and yet praise this game even though it does the same exact thing. You play through it the first time and think \"oh man I can't wait to play through again and make that choice instead\" just to find out that the choice doesn't matter, the same thing happens anyways but with different dialogue. The only option you have is to go the evil route which just so happens to be horribly written...and still doesn't change anything in the long run.\n\nThen we get to the obvious cut content. A week before launch they said the upper city would be able to be fully explored. Then the game launched and, thanks to the upper city not being in the game like they said it would be, one of the main villains is on top of a gatehouse leading into the city just waiting for you to walk up to him and do his anti-climatic fight and Cazador's palace is on top of the city walls! There's other cut content as well like Avernus, but thankfully the rest of it isn't extremely obvious. \n\nBut lets bring up the elephant in the room. The insanely lustful companions. Gale comes onto you so hard that unless you're a complete a-hole to him, he just considers you to be in a relationship. You wanna romance Karlach? Well she's going to try to push you into being in a poly relationship with the entire party. You wanna say hi to Halsin at the party? He's in love with you now, get ready to have to tell him off later. \n\nOn top of that the game has the same issues as every other modern fantasy addition. It's packed full of cussing and sexual comments and content. That doesn't make it cool and edgy, it makes it uncouth and shatters immersion. Not to mention the lore being half ignored. Sure, that half that they don't ignore is more than Wizards of the Coast does with official D&D products these days, but that's still a massive issue. \"This area was destroyed by the shadow curse!\" No it was destroyed by the spell plague. That time when Shar had Mystra killed and her death devastated the world and let Shar transform the Shadow Plane into the Shadowfel where she funneled souls to herself. Not to mention Selune's divine realm being destroyed and her having to go live with Sune for a bit (who doesn't even get mentioned in the game other than a sex book in Raph's lair). None of that was worth so much as a comment in the game with a heavy focus on Selune and Shar's conflict? And of course, let's not forget changing a fantasy world to be \"modern\" with a particular focus on it in Act 3.", "timestamp_created": 1706019045, "timestamp_updated": 1706019045, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 107, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610530436038970947", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156495871": {"recommendationid": "156495871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054108303", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 13990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13990, "last_played": 1704486408}, "language": "english", "review": "Baldur's Gate 3 is a magnificent journey that immerses players in a world of magic, mystery, and mayhem. From the very beginning, the game captures your attention with its stunning visuals, engaging storytelling, and intricate character development. Larian Studios has truly outdone themselves in creating an experience that pays homage to the beloved Baldur's Gate series while introducing fresh and innovative gameplay mechanics.\n\nThe first two acts of the game are nothing short of brilliant. The attention to detail in the environments, the diverse array of characters, and the complex narrative choices make for a truly unforgettable experience. The combat system is both strategic and dynamic, offering a perfect blend of classic RPG elements and modern gameplay.\n\nThe character creation and progression system in Baldur's Gate 3 are exceptional, allowing players to mold their characters into unique personalities with their own strengths, weaknesses, and backstories. The companions you encounter throughout your journey are well-written and add depth to the overall narrative, with each having their own quirks and motivations.\n\nHowever, where Baldur's Gate 3 falters is in its final act. The journey to the climax is nothing short of spectacular, but as the story reaches its pinnacle, the experience becomes marred by a noticeable lack of polish. Quests become less refined, and the overall level of detail in both the narrative and the environment seems to take a hit.\n\nWhile the final act still manages to deliver a satisfying conclusion to the overarching story, the lack of polish is undeniable. Some plotlines feel rushed, and there are instances where the game's performance dips, breaking the otherwise immersive experience.

Because I can:\n1) Level Cap Limitations. Yes I've read the guff online of people defending the limit of 12, but they could easily have allowed you to level up to 15-16, without ruining the enjoyment of the game. Once you are in act 3 and you hit 12, you still have loads to do. Although I found most fights fun at 12, a few more levels, would have stopped me having to do a bit of cheese (and this was only on balanced mode, mind). If there are certain overpowered spells, remove or nerf them. They have basically done this already anyway. Dispel Magic anyone?\n2) Inventory and Storage system. It's such a faff, yes I've seen worse, but I've also seen better. One chest for storage in your camp with limited sort options. No stacking of the same items, so many dagger slots!\n3) The Aggro is too random. In the Goblin camp, you get into it with one group. Every Goblin in the world turns on you. In a prison you break someone out, kill all the guards and you are flirting with their colleagues at the top of the stairs, whilst the escaped prisoner is stood next to you. As the Goblin Camp is your first experience. It restricts experimentation, as you try and avoid combat in situations that are valid options, as you expect every man and their dog to turn on you.\n4) It's too woke. Only joking.

The only other game that made me feel this way when walking around it was probably Kingdom come: Deliverance just because of how realistic it feels, Realistic in a sense that it feels like you could very well see something similar in real life, people going about their day, working their jobs, doing their routines, I feel like that's that something that is rarely captured and done well in RPG's or is something that is simply overlooked and barely given any attention to by the developers.\n\nThe voice actors and actresses also did an amazing job as well as the writing team, each character was incredibly interesting thanks to them. None of the main characters are boring carbon copies of each other, they all have their own personalities, mannerisms, they all have deep stories that you end up uncovering more and more as you progress through the game making them feel even more fleshed with each part of the game, and the voice actors and actresses did an amazing job translating all of that into their voices. \n\nThe writing is outstanding for both the NPC's and the Playable characters, The writing got me immersed in my characters to the point when I was picking dialogue I wasn't looking for the option with the best outcome but what MY character would say, whereas in other games like Skyrim, Kingdom come or fallout I would often do the opposite. The character creator is also really good, every time I created a new character for a different play through I would always end up building lore of that character in my head, I never wanted to just make a character that just looks cool, I also wanted them to have a story prior to the events of the game.\n\nIf you don't know whether you should buy the game or not because you might not end up liking, trust me, give it a go. You have two hours of playtime to refund the game if you don't end up liking it, or you can get the game through other means although I urge you to buy it if you're interested in it and have the money to do so. I have never played a game in this genre prior to Baldurs gate 3, My main interest in games were competitive multiplayer games such as counter strike, rainbow six siege, call of duty and I have the hours to back it up on my profile, *2800 hours on counter strike, 1800 hours on R6 siege.* I ended up loving it and it caused me and my friends to gain massive interest in DnD to the point where we're planning on setting up a campaign at some point. \n\nBaldurs gate 3 has set a new standard for games, I think it's unfair to expect indie games to be held to the same standard as Baldurs gate 3. But AAA games SHOULD be and NEED to be held to the standard of Baldurs gate 3, it's ridiculous that these massive studios are releasing broken half completed games for full price, some of them having gold or special editions which cost even more and rarely add anything of value to the game, not to mention how many times the studios attack or ridicule people when they go to point the obvious flaws a game has or even when providing constructive criticism.\n\nI very rarely write reviews for games, And the ones that I did end up writing were mostly Meme/Joke reviews not to be taken seriously.

The idea of two elderly delving into a fantasy world of wizards and warriors seemed absurd. But my husband, always the adventurer at heart, was intrigued. Together, we decided to give it a try, thinking it would be a humorous story to share with our friends.\n\nThe first time we played, it was a comedy of errors. I couldn't tell an elf from an orc, and my husband's wizard spent more time accidentally casting spells on himself than on the enemies. But as we fumbled through the game, something wonderful happened. We started laughing together like we hadn't in years. Each gaming session became a new adventure, filled with both in-game challenges and fits of laughter from our clumsy mistakes.\n\nAs we journeyed through the rich story and complex puzzles of \"Baldur's Gate,\" we began to work as a team, just like in the early days of our marriage. We strategized together, celebrated our victories, and consoled each other in our defeats. The game became our nightly ritual, a time where we could escape to a fantastical world and reconnect.\n\nPlaying \"Baldur's Gate\" rekindled something in our relationship that we thought we had lost. We found new topics to talk about, reminiscing about our in-game adventures during the day. Our shared interest in the game led to other shared activities, reigniting the spark that brought us together all those years ago.\n\n\"Baldur's Gate\" became more than just a game for us; it was a gateway to rediscovering each other. It showed us that no matter how long you've been together, there are always new and exciting ways to connect and grow as a couple. Our evenings in front of the computer, exploring the Sword Coast, became cherished moments, a testament to the enduring power of love and laughter.", "timestamp_created": 1706076022, "timestamp_updated": 1706076022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567513346672058105", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158128938": {"recommendationid": "158128938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081229530", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 11044, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9216, "playtime_at_review": 10783, "last_played": 1707789148}, "language": "english", "review": "I played a bit of early access a year ago or so. So when I started playing this game in full release, I already knew it was going to be pretty good. But the full release was far better than my own expectations. This already is most likely one of my favourite games and I have yet to explore other possibilities ingame. \n\nThe finale of every act feels so rewarding after all your efforts. The details in every zone are amazing, i found myself exploring every single room and corner of the world and collecting books, notes and other papers full of lore. \n\nMy favourite Act was definitely Act III but not to say Act I and II were bad. It was because of the previous Acts that Act III made sense and felt so satisfying. \n\nMy favourite arc (if you can call it that) was House of Hope or Raphael's arc. I'm sure most of the players agree they enjoyed his song during his \"boss fight\". This poetic devil named Raphael is one my favourite characters. I think he and Mizora truly represent what we know of devils. (Nice detail on 666HP). Hope was also cool, wholesome and funny. How am I not gonna save her during my evil run...\n\nMy favourite companion is predictable I know, but yes Shadowheart and I am not talking about romance (only). Every character really developed during the story and trying to solve their own personal problems while fighting together to solve their common problem, the illithid tadpoles stuck in their brains and saving the world from the Absolute (or not depending on your choices). Most characters (even NPCs) have a story, a personality, a opinion of their own, So sometimes, if you are making certain decisions, you might not just be affecting the main or secondary characters but also a \"random\" NPC walking by.\n\nCinematics were amazing and well planned. I used screenshot a lot!\nI hope the voice actors of this game were payed good. The characters felt so real with their emotions and personalities. The team who worked on expressions and body language helped a lot to give the characters life of course.\n\nA few extras I feel the need to say:\nShadow isles was the hardest part imo. It did indeed felt how hard it was to live in those conditions and the amount of destruction in the various places of the map caused by the curse.

Story is mediocre and looks are 10 years behind (they didn't have the same budget nor time so couldn't work miracles) but at least the combat is solid.\n\nIf you don't care about getting \"5e representative experience\", then this is the one game you can and should play before most others.\n\n=== Detailed review ===\nSo finally it's here the long-awaited game after 2 years of early access. \nThere is no doubt it's a gem overall, but there are a few caveats to be aware of still.\nFor most people these would be inconsequential though.\n\n== Story ==\n11/10. Yup, no mistake. Didn't finish the game yet to be honest, but could already witness from several parallel games with different groups how far they went into providing decisive choices and consequences ending up with vastly different narratives (we're not speaking of a few secondary characters being alive or dead or choosing between A, A' and A'' endings here, but entire chunks of stories being tossed apart, the destiny of Baldur's Gate - and your own - being like different dimensions).\n\n== Narration ==\n11/10. Yep, still no mistake. Not only do you have, literally, a thousand different NPCs in the game, ALL of them have voice-acting. The \"worst\" part is... Only about half of them have interesting bits of informations or quests to offer. \"Only\". xd\nBy the way, no worries, actors were paid well this time, and it feels. Intonations and rythms are really \"inplace\" with what's being said, so you're like, watching a movie, except you actually have impact on their destinies this time.\n\n== Aesthetics (lights, photography, layout, characters, effects, animations) ==\n9/10. You'll travel through a great variety of lanscapes each providing an unique identity. Places have been designed with three dimensions in mind and it feels, while not the magnitude of a Breath of the Wild you'll stop quite often to appreciate the design.\n\nChracters are well-modelled, effects are nice... Nothing much to say here, it's worth of a 2023 AAA.\n\n== Music ==\n7/10. Does its job well, but apart from the main theme, I doubt I'll remember any of those 10 years from now. \nBut hey it's always something very personal here.\nFrom a purely \"technical\" point of view, music is always matching the situation in terms of instruments, tempos and \"narrative style\".\n\n== UX ==\n3/10. A real catastrophe here, although counter-intuitively it's a bit better on gamepad since you can \"organize\" (painfully) all your abilities in different rings.\nBut overall, and in spite of a few nice ideas like different ways to sort things and ways to exchange items... I've never been that lost in an interface. EVEN WHEN PLAYING THE SAME \"SIMPLE\" CHARACTER (aka not a Druid with dozen of different spells available) SPANNING DOZEN OF HOURS.\nThe main problem is dual: the fact the person who chose/designed icons must have been blind. And the fact there are so many things that clutter your \"action bars\" dynamically. \nThey tried to resolve it after the fact by providing tabs which filter by class or by action type but even then the icons are far too small, far too simple in design and far too similar from one another for you to get your way through. Ah and bonus point: their position will change too. Obviously.\nThey should have taken a lesseon, or rather a semester of it, from Tactical Adventures. It's far less shiny but it's 100x times more efficient.\n\n== Gameplay (combat apart) ==\n8/10: you have exploration, you have social confrontation with lots of options depending on your background/class/characteristics/reputation, you have puzzles, every animal and corpse (nearly) have things to say... \nThere are a lot they did neatly here, and they grasped the essence of D&d as far as exploration and social pillars go...\nHOWEVER...\n\n== Gameplay (Combat) ==\n5/10. Yup. I stand by it. Not that it's too simple or bland mind you. It's because they went so far in trying to \"bring their touch\" they ended up with a Frankenstein of balance.\nArtificially try to play the closest to Authentic 5e, you'll probably have a hard day or possibly get wrecked. \nLean into their changes to class, their additions of \"surfaces\" and \"stackable effects\", their \"story-born powers\", the \"physics applied to fantasy game yet every character jumps farther than the best olympic\" elements? You can range from frustrating experience to insipid \"stomp everything\" one, and everything in between. It's like the mess of a 3year old child taking all toys together to throw them around in chaos.\n\nAnd in parallel to that they brought some nerfs that are, even with the best goodwill of the world, completely voided of any logic or reason. Which for some even go straight against their apparent goal design of \"enjoy the powercreep and have fun experimenting various combinations\".\n\nThis is probably a perfect ground for people who like spending dozen hours comparing equipment and character combinations \"a la diablo\" before even playing. But this brings a completely heterogeneous experience from one game to another, and from one player to another.\n\nThings are even worsened by their other stupidest idea, \"simultaneous turns\". Which could have actually been great... IF YOU COULD REWIND. \nCountless times did I see wasted resources and turns because players don't really coordinate and end up wasting each other's time.\n\nReally, the biggest disappointment of the game for me, and it didn't even miss the mark by much. They just needed to respect all 5e rules while keeping their level and encounter design.

However, it is not for everyone. Consider this a Mixed review.\n\n[h1]Is this for you?[/h1]\nFor context, I am a huge fan of tactical strategy games, turn based RPGs, CRPGs, and narrative heavy games. I have all that qualities of someone who should love this game, at least in theory.\n\nIn my eyes, it's not quite Baldur's Gate enough to be considered a natural continuation of the franchise. Simultaneously, it's not freeform enough to be considered Divinity: Original Sin 3. It's like an awkward mixture of both with modified DnD 5e rules thrown in. In some areas, it works quite well, but the vast majority of the fusion feels half-baked.\n\nMy theory is that the high score comes from three camps:\n[list]\n[*] People who have never played the Divinity Franchise and like DnD\n[*] Larian super fans\n[*] Gamers who are starved for good games by the lack of new good quality AAA titles and general bad business practices from them.\n[/list]\n\n\nIf you're like me on the other hand, I don't typically lean on AAA titles to maximize my enjoyment out of gaming. I have played previous Larian games before and this doesn't come off as much different than their previous entry, Divinity: Original Sin 2.\n\n[h1]I heard you like dice rolls...[/h1]\nLet's talk about the most obvious low-hanging fruit: The dice roll mechanic. The implementation of the mechanic is over-saturated. You roll for most things, even if you're adept at whatever skill you are trying to check for. This trivializes the entire mechanic and also shows a lack of fundamental understanding of why you even roll dice on skill checks in the first place. You typically roll for things that are [b]not[/b] part of your character's core skills, unless the particular check is more difficult than average or it presents a clear and present danger/importance to the party. \n\nInstead, there are a ton of 10 or under level skill checks thrown in on most things, especially locks. If you are playing with a rogue (or bring Astarion), you are going to succeed on the vast majority of these unlocks. It seems as if the simple solution is to bypass the check for rolls if you have modifiers that would only cause failure in the case of a 1. That would at least take out 80% of the cruft associated with trivial rolls.\n\nOn the same token, let's talk about more difficult rolls and their underwhelming results. Most of these more difficult rolls are for dialogue options, and these are difficult even if you have proficiency in them. Only rarely have I had a difficult check result in something that changed the outcome of a predetermined event, but it is inexcusable to not have ALL incredibly difficult checks result in some kind of a boon to the player if they succeed. Using two examples: There's an intimidation check you can succeed for one of the boss encounters in Act 2. When you succeed that, the leader convinces his followers to kill themselves. This... feels awesome and makes the coming fight much easier. In the same Act, you fight another boss in which you have to succeed two difficult checks in a row. The last one is nearly impossible to get without tons of extra modifiers or a perfect 20. If you do succeed you get... more dialogue and no changes to the fight what-so-ever. All this does is punish players who want to get the most out of the story by leaving certain outcomes gated by luck.\n\n[h1]The Rest is history[/h1]\nI understand what they were trying to do with short rests and long rests, but it could have been implemented in a way that makes sense to both game flow and 5e rules.\n\nThe core problem is this: The combat system encourages you to go into encounters, be sparing with some of your more powerful abilities and spells until you really need them and do 'soft-resets' by short resting so you can be ready for more encounters before you have to inevitably return to camp. This can work in theory, but there are a two major factors working against this system.\n\nFirstly, there aren't a lot of trivial encounters in the game. While there are definitely some, the vast majority of combat encounters have lots of enemies, characters getting bursted down to critically low health, or require you to dip into some of your limited abilities to be efficient. While you can just short rest and continue, you severely reduce your likelihood of success if your characters are at low/mid health for the next encounter. I did try to limit long resting as much as possible, but then realized that there wasn't much point in doing that as you end up drowning in camping supplies the more you progress. Short resting was a simple 'push your luck and continue' option.\n\nSecond, healing is almost pointless in this game outside of resting. Some of your stronger heals, even when upcasting them, tend to barely restore the HP of the character you're targeting. It's far better to use the limited spell slots for a more offensive/utility driven spell. Even the group party heal you get out of combat sucks. I did find one potential use for healing (though I admit, I've never played a healing character in DnD and didn't know this was legal) and that's bringing up a character that is 'down', performing saving throws. My thought was that they can only be healed if brought up from that downed state by using the 'help' action. Turns out, I was using my heals incorrectly the vast majority of my play through. Ah well.\n\n[h1]Play the story [strike]you[/strike] I want to play, or else![/h1]\nThis is a personal gripe and I'm sure different characters will yield different results but I want to say that I played Gale the way 'I' thought his story should play out. I did not know that by doing so, [spoiler]it would prematurely end my game[/spoiler] and despite the 'sort-of' resolution, it was unsatisfying. But what was even more unsatisfying was that in order to continue, I had to replay that scene and just pretend that Gale had different motivations. It begs the question: why even present that as a choice to the player, while also giving tidbits into his background and personal motivations, just to punish the player by following through with it? I'm not expecting a narrative epic with thousands of branching pathways depending on responses, but it seems like a design oversight. Maybe it's just an example of 'Larian humor' but it removed a lot of my motivation to continue.\n\nWhat's worse, your own character's motivations as your approach act 3 become so disjointed with the story up until that point, it makes me wish I accepted what I got early and stopped there. It seems to be typical with Larian that the story starts strong and ends up significantly weaker the further you go on. It happened with Divinity: Original Sin 2 and I'm not shocked it's here as well.\n\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\nThat's a whole lot of negatives so why am I claiming this a 'mixed' review instead of a outright negative one?\n\nDespite this game not being for me, it is very clearly made with love for a specific audience in mind. Most of my criticism are not game breaking and depending on your character selections, you may not even encounter the problems I did. Still, you don't need my review to convince you. There are clearly a vast majority of gamers who did enjoy their experiences. I'm only offering my perspective to sway those who may be on the fence.\n\nAll-in-all, using the combat system as an analogy: You have advantage on a 93% chance of liking this game. Probability says you 'will' like this game, but don't be surprised if it's a miss for you. That's just how things play out sometimes.\n\n[i]Should mention that the original review went more in-depth into some areas and had to be cut to meet the current text character restriction.

The reveals, complexity of characters and plot is trully something that amazed me here. It also deals well with hard dilemas and choices, making the most important ones not always beeing between good and evil, but whether you will give up one valuable thing over another with meaninglful sacrifices. The companions and the main cast have so much personality that even if most of them fited into classic RPG archetypes still felt unique in their own right.\nAll of that great scenes are, to my displeasure, paired with surprising lack of some small dialouges between characters building our bonds and trying to side with one over another. I understand that it is a result of the 3d cutscenes that makes creating a many shorter scenes more costly but without them we have quite empty reputation system that makes green lizard want to get into my pants without me realising why and creating the infamous sex speedrun. Another shortcoming of the story is a underdeveloped main antagonist that suffered because of lesser villans having much more screen time and the need for a game to have more flexibility, still it could have been done better.\n\nGoing to gameplay I must praise the enemy encounters, each of them unique with its gimmicks and enemies that require at least some thought from the player and allowing for intresting or straight up funny strategies. The balance of the game is so well done that I, on my first playthrough, was able to beat the hard mode of the game without special powers or much minmaxing and seating 30 minutes on an encounter, only reloading individual ones maximum like 3 times. I of course sometimes run upon a fight way too hard for mee for a time but the game always allows you to go back, gear up with powerful consumables, and try again.\nBuuuut it does not mean that the system is flawless, melee fighters doing otk on you characters and first strike capabilites being difference between life and death are problems, but they can too be used by the player, so it cancels for difficulty purposes but still left me a bad taste in my mouth.\nOther issues of this part are mosty related to lack of quality of life, too large hitboxes of some enemies, messed up pathing that only sometimes avoids triggering traps and other perils, quite easy to get yourself hit by opportunity attack if you clicked wrong, you want to see or target something on the other floor, frick you. There are solutions to all this problems, do it manually by the means of turn mode and careful observation or just knowing when the broken systems are working and learning their rules because it is not hard to deal with it if you know what is going on, but their inconsistancy is still the thong that drives me mental. One time I could avoid the minefield and deal with encounter with minimal friction and the other time I would accidently explode the entire minefield that I knew that was there and then end up in a fight were my allies just decided it was time to die for nothing. And the finall straw was that the programmers messed up the most basic change giving algorithm that is the camp supplies, like it is the first thing that you learn in the IT classes, and still they couldn't do it right and what is even weirder, is that if you click the second time on the button it somehow works correctly!?! \nI will not even talk about some dialogue bugs, circa 10 crashes throughout entire playthrough and some soft lock with one mod I had that happend because of a minor hotfix in game, like the code of this game is propably a huge mess of spaghetti.\n\nAt least visual and musical teams done their job well and I trully enjoyed both scenery, models and soundtrack. All of that on my almost outdated graphics card without much lags or truly low quality graphics. I must admit that in bigger cities the game tended to work much slower but it did not ruin the experience.\n\nAll in all the game is trully something amazing and woth recommendation but it should have remained in early acces for another year or at least invest more into their programming team. So If you are not sure you want to buy it I would recommend waitng another half a year or so for some greater sale.", "timestamp_created": 1705876096, "timestamp_updated": 1705876096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156454467": {"recommendationid": "156454467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198411342269", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 64026, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 479, "playtime_at_review": 60078, "last_played": 1707322635}, "language": "english", "review": "yok \u00f6nermiyorum", "timestamp_created": 1705833072, "timestamp_updated": 1705833072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156442425": {"recommendationid": "156442425", "author": {"steamid": "76561199478819439", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 9343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7736, "last_played": 1706442011}, "language": "english", "review": "You can pet the dog AND owlbear AT THE SAME TIME. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1705820009, "timestamp_updated": 1705820009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156371759": {"recommendationid": "156371759", "author": {"steamid": "76561199083808772", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 17979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4105, "playtime_at_review": 10102, "last_played": 1707602745}, "language": "english", "review": "just finished it for the first time. it's still too early to tell whether i like it or not, might need to give it a couple more hours", "timestamp_created": 1705752225, "timestamp_updated": 1705752225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156312713": {"recommendationid": "156312713", "author": {"steamid": "76561199079643694", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 12839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4603, "playtime_at_review": 6746, "last_played": 1707716766}, "language": "english", "review": "So.

Acts 1 and 2 are intricately designed, offering immersive role-playing experiences. However, Act 3 encounters a bit of quest log bloat, turning the adventuring experience into more of a checklist, with most quests inevitably leading to combat. However, Larian does an exceptional job at delivering a rich narrative that grapples with numerous story threads that are eventually skillfully woven together by the end of act 3.\n\nDespite its virtues, the game is not without flaws. Overwhelming DnD 5e mechanics, a departure from the traditional DnD experience, pose a challenge at times. In BG3, the world is a sandbox, sometimes casting players in the dual roles of both Dungeon Master and adventurer, creating a rich yet occasionally overwhelming experience.\n\nNonetheless, BG3 distinguishes itself as an exceptional RPG experience. In an era saturated with live-service games and questionable monetization practices, it remains a valuable gem, delivering a genuine and fulfilling role-playing adventure.

This is an adventure that will stick with you long after the end. One that you can go back to multiple times and have wholly different experiences with on each pass, or compare with others who have played.[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Not only the story of the character you choose to play, but that of your band of misfits and many others you meet along the way are (almost) all equally as compelling.[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Between all of the different party compositions and build variety for every character (including multiclassing), you can approach everything the game throws at you in (almost) any way you can think of.[/b]\r\n\r\n[b][u][i]Very high recommend.[/i][/u][/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[h3]The long version.[/h3]\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed (almost) all of my time with BG3. The world, the characters, the story, the side stories, the combat - they're all very well done and show a clear love for the project put in from the developers, voice actors, and everyone involved in making the game.\r\nI've had an eye on BG3 since it's been in Early Access and have been looking forward to going through it.\r\n\r\nThe mechanics of the game definitely feel fair. \r\nThe dialogue and skill checks make sense for the situations they come up in. Seeing the results, both good and bad, and dealing with the consequences of these checks definitely added to the feel that the world is being shaped by you and your choices.\r\n\r\nThe game immediately hooks you with the opening hours. Just about everything in Act 1 is put together masterfully.\r\nExploring every inch of the wilderness and finding all there is to find, while recruiting your companions along the way, is a blast.\r\nHere is where the world really feels alive, with so many quests and requests that tie together in a natural way. Lots of characters whose fates are tied to your actions and lots that get you thinking \"I bet I'll see them again later\" once you wrap up whatever they had going on.\r\nHeading to camp after completing a big quest to hear everyone's takes on what just happened is always fun.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are a lot of \"(almost)\"s above and in the TL;DR, and the reasons for those show a lot more in the 2 later acts.\r\nThe game absolutely retains all of the good in Act 2 - massive areas to explore, hidden areas that can be completely missed, new quests to complete, new characters to meet. But there are definitely signs of content that was started up and then altered or altogether removed during the Early Access development for whatever reason.\r\nAgain, nothing major or gamebreaking, there were just a couple of times where I had the thought of \"oh, I thought they were going to do something more with that\".\r\n\r\nDuring act 3 is where my enjoyment decreased quite a bit, for a number of reasons. Definitely not to the point of wanting to stop going through the game, but the amount of issues that appeared added up over time.\r\nAct 3 as a whole just felt generally less well put together. I was surprised at the amount of technical issues I encountered here. Bugs like quest markers on the map not updating properly, or being locked into a dialogue with the camera pointed at the wall and not being able to choose any options are small things - easily remedied by reloading the save. Except when your last save is from 30+ minutes ago...\r\nPerformance also noticeably degrades here and things like animations in cutscenes bug out or shake in a distracting way.\r\nOf course, bugs and performance issues like this won't happen for everyone, and some players may not even notice or care about them.\r\n\r\nHowever, what will affect most all players are bugs relating to quest progression. Without getting into spoilers I did encounter a few quests where they either would not progress correctly, or, somehow, progressing [i]too much[/i].\r\nOn not progressing correctly - a few quests had a lot of trouble with some objectives being done out of order, which struck me as odd here since other quests earlier in the game (as well as other games) typically accounted for things like this. This led to needing to search for fixes online from others who ended up in similar spots and going through tedious steps like dropping specific items in certain areas and picking them back up to force the progression to continue.\r\nOn progressing too much - one particular important questline for a main companion appeared to complete for me much earlier than it was supposed to, giving me a lot of information that was supposed to be revealed later in the game.\r\n\r\nLarian is actively still putting out patches and hotfixes for the game though, so I don't doubt that issues like these will likely be addressed and corrected in the future.\r\n\r\nStill, overall, Baldur's Gate 3 is a [i][b][u]fantastic[/u][/b][/i] video game. Honestly one of the best in recent years and it can definitely be classified as a \"must-play\".", "timestamp_created": 1707508133, "timestamp_updated": 1707508133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157723294": {"recommendationid": "157723294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079707089", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1812, "playtime_at_review": 1374, "last_played": 1707783048}, "language": "english", "review": "man i sure wish i had a gate", "timestamp_created": 1707236554, "timestamp_updated": 1707236554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157687324": {"recommendationid": "157687324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088680625", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 10220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5913, "playtime_at_review": 8233, "last_played": 1707600834}, "language": "english", "review": "HASTE\nCREATE WATER\nCALL LIGHTNING\nQUICKENED SPELL ACTIVATE CALL LIGHTNING\nFREEZING CLAWS\nFREEZING CLAWS\nELECTRIC FLAIL\nDESTRUCTIVE WRATH GLYPH OF WARDING LIGHTNING\nHIEMAL STRIKE", "timestamp_created": 1707184833, "timestamp_updated": 1707184905, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157633374": {"recommendationid": "157633374", "author": {"steamid": "76561198382229670", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5992, "playtime_at_review": 1856, "last_played": 1707796585}, "language": "english", "review": "Only just beginning but so far things this game has and will succeed at doing: \n\n- Give you severe sleep deprivation\n- Make you question if its us thats not living in a simulation\n- Make you forget what sunlight even is\n- Keep you invested and busy all year as someone who works long hours, I know I will be replaying the living infernal hell out of this game!!\n\nI had almost lost hope that good RPGs were a thing of the past but Larian has delivered, thank you for this diamond <3", "timestamp_created": 1707117892, "timestamp_updated": 1707117892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157468137": {"recommendationid": "157468137", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092446037", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 12807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 884, "playtime_at_review": 11922, "last_played": 1707796622}, "language": "english", "review": "laezel got them frog titties", "timestamp_created": 1706941280, "timestamp_updated": 1706941280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157210446": {"recommendationid": "157210446", "author": {"steamid": "76561199544582351", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 929, "playtime_at_review": 2856, "last_played": 1707778513}, "language": "english", "review": "shadowheart feet \ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24", "timestamp_created": 1706643761, "timestamp_updated": 1706643761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156798891": {"recommendationid": "156798891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198373491760", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 13581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13530, "last_played": 1706219641}, "language": "english", "review": "226 hours on this game.\nI'm still not out of act 1 help me please.\n\nI think 85% of my time was trying to make the sexiest [insert race] alive.\n\nJoke aside, i wasn't meant to buy the game for that much (70 bucks). \nBut i wanted to try a DnD game, so here i bought it.\n\nGraphics are just that good, i love turn based combat so it's a big plus to me.\nBut uh yeah...

I don't usually play games with turn-based combat (except Pokemon but that's a different kettle of fish) so that was a bit of a learning curve, but start on the easiest difficulty while you're learning, and you'll do just fine. You can change the difficulty at any time - a welcome accessibility feature - among many many other customisable settings to help your experience run smoothly and fit your individual needs.\r\n\r\nThe characters in this game feel alive. The voice acting is just on another level, and there's hundreds, maybe thousands, of hours of voice-acted lines that bring the game to life and allow you to really connect with the characters. Each of the main characters has their own individual backstory, personality, vulnerabilities and strengths, all of which you get to learn naturally throughout the progression of the game, with thoughtfully timed cut-scenes and interesting dialogue. Your choices really do matter too, you feel like you're actually making an impact on how the story unfolds.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, this game's main mechanics are based heavily upon Dungeons and Dragons 5e, and if you're worried about not knowing how to play D&D, let me reassure you that you do not need to know how to play D&D to play BG3. In fact, I've learnt a lot about how to play D&D through playing BG3! There are of course differences between them but it's certainly a nice starting point.\r\n\r\nI genuinely, wholeheartedly have not felt so passionate about a game since I first played Skyrim. It's visually stunning, the story is compelling, and the characters feel alive. There's plenty of side-questing, and thorough exploration is handsomely rewarded throughout the game - that's why I'm 70hrs in and still in Act 1 of 3! Obviously everyone has their own play styles, and all I can say is this game fits mine beautifully. I feel like I could write a whole essay on what I love about this game to try and convince you to play it, but instead, I implore you to stop wasting time reading this, and just go and experience it for yourself!

I just had to with Baldur's Gate 3. \n\nTo start, this game has blown me away. To it's unique take on the saturated fantasy art style, the landscapes you traverse and most importantly, the characters you meet in the journey. Baldur's Gate 3 is a wonderful experience from the moment you launch it, to more than likely, when you end the game as well. As a review in progress I'd like to clarify that at this moment I have not beaten the final act of the game. What I can confidently say is that Larian studios has totally taken over my life with how interesting and player-driven the game can be. It's very easy to say I'll do this one encounter and easily add another 3-4 hours after you quest for a decent amount of time. The abilities are cool, the classes are better (coming from a DOS2 player), player freedom is at an all time high. I've only encountered two bugs. One was a mesh clipping error and caused the npc I was talking to have a problem not teleporting everywhere lol. Second was a small texture pop in error early in the second Act of the game (enemy casted a large, blackening AOE) I had to re-load my save file. \n\nTwo very minimal things in a wonderfully crafted story, curated enviroments, and a loving cast.

The length and complexity of each act is almost beyond comprehension. \r\n\r\nQuite often nowadays in games, you have NPCs that are purely for decoration, no more than set dressing in the same way a cardboard box is placed next to a dumpster in a city's back street. Baldur's Gate 3 says fuck all that, and makes every NPC you come across have some kind of purpose, whether you know it or not.\r\n\r\nThis is on top of incredibly robust interaction systems, meaning if you can think of a way to engage with a situation, you can probably do it. A common selling point of games, especially since the Xbox 360/PS3 era, was the slogan \"Play it [i]your[/i] way!\", and Baldur's Gate 3 is almost the only truthful manifestation of that phrase. You really can engage with it in anyway you see fit. The game doesn't stop you, it makes you live with the consequences.\r\n\r\nIt has issues, like the pacing and performance towards the end of the game, and honestly the UI could do with a once-over to make it a little more readable, but overall this is a fundamental achievement in game design, and will live on for generations to come.

The interactions and scenarios the developers built into every conceivable event makes the gameplay unique and exciting for both video game and pen and paper enthusiasts. \n\nThat said, this game has a steep learning curve. The tutorial and early encounters assume the player has a working knowledge of how D&D 5e mechanics function, a familiarity with action economy, and how to balance classes to make a functional party. The Balanced difficulty has many enemies utilizing the environment and skill check actions not made clear as options to the player. Once you understand and have a master of these things the game is an extremely rewarding and enjoyable experience; until you do so, however, it can be a grueling grind. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend the game.

I happen to be a long time player and D&D DM but you don't need to know anything about it to enjoy this game. If you enjoyed Dragon Age back in the day, you'll love BG3. \n\nPros: \n\nI've also never played BG1 or 2 but it is absolutely not requires as the story stands alone and there's plenty of opportunities to pick up lore if you like that. \n\nLove the companions and their stories, the voice acting is fantastic. \n\nCons:\n\nI do wish there were variation in the types of voices for Tav, especially the women's, they all sound kind of samish. Some different accents would be welcome. Also, more variation for Tav's appearance would be great. Having to choose between such a small number of preset faces is disappointing. Having so many choices of genitalia (which I appreciate, don't get me wrong) which you hardly ever see but like...  6 possible faces which you see all the time... Well. Modding is lovely but the base game should stand on its own.\n\nThe game gets laggy very quickly and takes forever to load. Now, my machine is not top of the range but it should, according to the game itself, be able to play on Medium settings, which is good enough for me at this time of empty pockets. The thing is, even in Low, I have to exit the game regularly and restart it to get a period of some smoother play. \n\nConclusion: \n\nHas its technical issues and some weird character creator choices but it's a really great game otherwise and I really hope they make a direct sequel so we can do some high level play with the same characters.", "timestamp_created": 1705773229, "timestamp_updated": 1705773229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156343352": {"recommendationid": "156343352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198984683371", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1986, "playtime_at_review": 6739, "last_played": 1707675897}, "language": "english", "review": "I used to be disciplined, waking up at 8 am everyday, happily working and going to the gym whilst keeping up with hobbies.

The entry to this story is masterful and makes for very interesting storytelling both with the overarching grand plot as well as the small side encounters you'll find along the way.\n\nBeing thrust into the world of Faer\u00fbn might be daunting with years of lore behind it, but there's plenty of books and scrolls scattered in the world where you can read up on lore that will help you understand the setting better, but it's not required. Larian managed to keep the story quite easily understandable and the extra knowledge about lore will only enhance your experience rather than take away if you don't have it.\n\n[h3]Gameplay:[/h3]\nIt's going to be hard for me to sell you the gameplay if you're not interested in turn-based gameplay as I am a very big fan of it myself, and that's just my taste. But I have a lot of friends who don't play turn-based games who have loved this game. As it's turn-based your skill with navigating the controls won't matter too much, but rather your knowledge of the game and system. And I've seen many friends who don't play many games pick this monster of a game up and really enjoy it as they can take their time without stress.\n\nIt's all based on the Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition ruleset, which has its drawbacks in certain cases. For example, there's always a chance your hit will miss, which could be completely negated in their previous title Divinity Original Sin 2. But also Larian Studios have managed to tweak the ruleset to fit the video game platform really well, and most changes are definitely for the better. One major point here that differs from the tabletop RPG is the emphasis on gear and looting, and usually the gearpieces will help against the drawbacks of the system.\n\n[h3]Music and Ambience:[/h3]\nBorislav Slavov wrote a masterpiece of a soundtrack which sets the stage of every scene. The landscapes and ambient sound and music push the feel of every scene, all from the lush forest to a bustling city. I wholeheartedly recommend you don't look up some of the music of the game until you've played it, many songs contain spoilers either in titles or in the song itself. But I won't blame you if you can't resist, I definitely listened to the whole soundtrack whenever I wasn't playing the game.\n\n[h3]Performance[/h3]\nIt's clear from most who've played the game that the performance goes down throughout the three acts. Act 1 is great and has very few bugs and glitches, but those increase as you play the game. I was lucky enough and haven't encountered too many or breaking bugs during my time of playing.\n\nAlthough much of the criticism it's gotten for its poor late game performance has been changed, they've even added a lot to the epilogue of the game to flesh out the stories of all characters. If there's a time to play it it's definitely way more stable now than it was on release.\n\nOverall it's in great shape and I wouldn't tell anyone to not get this game because of the performance as of right now.\n\n[h3]Summary:[/h3]\nIf you still haven't picked this game up I highly recommend it to anyone interested in an epic story, want amazing character progression both mechanic and storywise or just want to cause chaos in a fantasy world. The developers deserve full price and I'd encourage you to support them. A fully finished game with tons of content and no microtransactions, we should reward that behaviour as gamers.\n\nOne point on the length of the game, I've heard many people say \"it's a 100h game, that's way too long for me\", and although yes it's very long I think it's an unfair argument. I'd compare this to a great TV or book series rather than a movie. For example, it's supposed to take its time and build up. And you're put on different crescendos and slow points as the game is structured in different acts that have their own climaxes. And if you need to take a longer break, the journal system is great to write out exactly what has happened and what your goals are, use it!\n\nLastly I'd like to give a few pointers for anyone picking this up, the obvious is don't look up anything beforehand and experience the game for yourself. There is no \"wrong\" way to do things, and even though it might make some things harder, always remember you can inspect any enemy to see their abilities and weaknesses.\n\nSecondly don't play for the first run with friends, if you must then maximum 2 people. You'll lose a lot of story from the companions by not being able to bring them along with the story with a full group of 4 player co-op.\n\nHope you have fun with this amazing game.", "timestamp_created": 1707756351, "timestamp_updated": 1707756351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158168760": {"recommendationid": "158168760", "author": {"steamid": "76561198805872875", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4157, "playtime_at_review": 6511, "last_played": 1707761664}, "language": "english", "review": "Squid romance option is top tier game development. 10/10 would recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1707755821, "timestamp_updated": 1707755821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158162013": {"recommendationid": "158162013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120851072", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1855, "playtime_at_review": 1660, "last_played": 1707772353}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolute banger.

This game is a great adaption of the classic game into video game form.

One of the best CRPGs of all time. (TIP - Rest a lot or you'll miss a lot of additional dialogue with your companions)\n\nIf you like RPGs, tactics, huge adventures and bears, the game is a must-buy. It's not a question. The only real question is: Are you into turn-based combat, tough choices, intrigues, ready to spend at least 100 hours+ into the game?\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nIt's an isometric RPG, very well executed. Combat is turn based, very similiar to Divinity Original Sin. You can exploit almost any fight as much as you want, throw hundreds of barrels upon your enemies just before setting them on fire. It's as bad as great in my opinion. I've talked to multiple bosses just to reload my save, setup a perfect ambush and just obliterate them without any dialogue. Seems weird. Boss too tough? Surround him with explosive barrels before a fight and blow his ass off,\n\nLarian did something great combining classical RPGs and their own style. You have your ordinary RPG: classes, abilities, XP, lockpicking, multiclasses. Then you have a simulated world that you can interact with in creative way. Can't pick a chest? Just take it away to open in camp or just smash the lock instead of lockpicking it. \n\nEXPLORATION\n\nI got bored of generic RPG games, which didn't reward a player for being curious. Be curious here. Go here, there and there and you'll be rewarded. Either be it with an item or even a quest. It definitely delivers the exploration aspect. It is dense and even emptier areas are packed with surprises. Characters, chests, secrets, stories, scrolls, books (READ THEM, they give lots of information and lore).\n\nSTORY\n\nIt's mostly great, but it kinda doesn't deliver at the end aswell. You've got a lot of choices to make, paths to decide, yet they get narrower the more the story progresses. It's hit and miss. Don't get me wrong, the acting, characters and story is still phenomenal, just uneven in my opinion.\nSome core characters miss a lot of opportunity to be even deeper, it just ends so quick with either black or white. The deeper we go, the shallower waters we encounter.\n\nCompanions are on a completely different level. You've got so many unique, talented, charismatic characters in this game, it blows my mind. To be fair their stories got me more engaged than the main story. Even though some of them left me immediately after some of my choices, I'm still eager to let another playthrough a go, just to see their stories and reactions.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\n\nCannot to mention the phenomenal OST.

Baldur's Gate 3 isn't just a game, it's a portal back to that magical era of sprawling Forgotten Realms adventures, reinvigorated with modern brilliance. Larian Studios hasn't simply captured the spirit of the Baldur's Gate legacy, they've infused it with their own brand of narrative audacity and tactical complexity, crafting an RPG experience that feels both nostalgic and revolutionary.\n\nStory woven with silk and shadow: Prepare to be enthralled by a tale that writhes and twists like a mindflayer tentacle. Your choices ripple through the narrative, leaving a trail of butterfly wings \u2013 or dragonfire, depending on your penchant for mischief. Every character pulsates with life and complexity. Their interwoven stories dance around yours, creating a tapestry rich in emotional resonance and moral quandaries.\n\nCombat: The turn-based battles are a masterclass in strategic depth. Every spell cast, every swing of the blade feels weighty and consequential. Positioning is everything, terrain becomes your playground, and creative spell combinations unleash symphonies of destruction. I've spent hours lost in tactical ecstasy, relishing the thrill of a perfectly executed ambush or the gut-punching defeat that forces me to rethink my entire approach.\n\nA feast for the senses: From the sun-drenched meadows of the Druid Grove to the claustrophobic depths of the Underdark, every inch of this world hums with visual splendor. Environments are meticulously crafted, brimming with detail and personality. The voice acting is superb, each character delivering their lines with a passion that pulls you deeper into the narrative. And the soundtrack? Oh, the soundtrack! Every note is an echo of adventure, a melody that fuels your spirit as you face down the perils of Faerun.\n\nIs it flawless? No. There is the occasional bug or stutter. But these are easily forgiven in the face of the magnificent whole.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 isn't just a game, it's a homecoming. It's a return to a world we cherish. It's a reminder of why we fell in love with RPGs in the first place. If you're seeking an adventure that will grip your soul, ignite your imagination, and leave you yearning for more, look no further. This is Baldur's Gate 3, and it's an absolute masterpiece.\n\n10/10 \u2013 An instant classic, hands down. Just try to pry yourself away from Faerun, I dare you.\n\nP.S. Don't forget to pet the dog.

Perhaps that speaks for itself. But if I had to give it a few more words: \n\nBG3 has quickly become one of my favorite games of all time. It is not without flaws. Bugs still populate Faerun in great numbers, and the freedom to solve problems in a myriad of ways means there are occasional moments where the logic of the game strains under the pressure of your creative choices. But the latter is also why I love the game so much; it feels like a place where I can make it my own, and take part in crafting the story of my character. \n\nMy biggest gripes after several playthroughs: \n- The game does not tell you that resting is a necessary way of progressing storylines and character arcs. Nearly every person I know that has played the game has mentioned that they missed out on a massive number of things because of this. The best fix would be a simple notification whenever a new camp scene becomes available. I hope Larian might add this by default, although modders have also fixed this by now. \n- The pacing of the game feels off, story-wise. Without spoilers, the urgency created by the end of Act 2 makes the entry into Act 3 feel as though there is time pressure to reach the endgame; other than a few small differences in the outcome of some side quests, there is no actual consequence to taking your time in Act 3. It also feels odd to be doing so many side quests in Act 3 when you have world-ending stakes hanging over you, but this complaint is only a small one, as I love how [i]big[/i] the world feels, and the breadth of content is part of that. \n\nMy biggest praises:\n- The characters, with very few exceptions, are written with emotional depth and complexity. I am constantly impressed by the writing of this game, in little corner of the world. I have been brought to tears, felt sadness and heartbreak, laughed at the absurdity, and asked to think deeply about conceptual topics. While not every one of the companion characters completely vibed with me, I can appreciate that they are all written in a way that makes them feel rooted in the world, with their own opinions and feelings and experiences. If you are patient as a player, and give them time to develop, they all have storylines that are rewarding and often incredibly moving. \n- The gameplay is endlessly entertaining, because you are given the freedom to re-spec your (and your companions') build whenever you wish. As someone who plays a fair bit of 5e, the game also feels like the best video game port that the ttrpg could hope for. \n- Larian has proven they are dedicated to supporting and polishing the game post-release. The addition of the magic mirror, and later the new epilogue scene, was incredibly welcome.

There's so much content in the two chapters we've been through so far, and I can't wait to keep playing. I'm currently a bard and I couldn't be happier. My boyfriend is a barbarian so we have the perfect balance of gameplay and we laugh until our sides hurt sometimes.

SAVE! \n\nThis game is VERY explorer heavy, loot everything and kill everything you can. Pet every animal you come across and chat up some cats, always some tea spilled there. Communicating with your party at camp is a fun immersive experience that will make you fall in love with some characters and will do anything for them to like you. I strove for a more balanced neutral campaign, and seems I am very well liked between my cohorts. \n\nAnyway I digress this game is 100% fun and playing with friends is even so much more fun that solo and is like you're playing in your own D&D group and no one has to DM. I give this a \ud835\udff4\ud835\udff5% rating, if there were no bugs at all, the game would be higher and if there was an option to include at least 2 more party members if your friend group is too big and don't wanna leave people out but that means I also wish there was a multiplayer game balance menu for the host to use in game sliders to make enemies CRs higher depending on the amount of people that are in the party and whatnot.", "timestamp_created": 1706025462, "timestamp_updated": 1706025462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156631989": {"recommendationid": "156631989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015464330", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "playtime_at_review": 5594, "last_played": 1706901615}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game with tons of replayability!", "timestamp_created": 1706021540, "timestamp_updated": 1706021540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156627879": {"recommendationid": "156627879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062384033", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 16026, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1421, "playtime_at_review": 13047, "last_played": 1707331169}, "language": "english", "review": "If you grew up playing old adventure games and story-driven RPGs like Dragon Age, this is everything you ever wanted and more.\n\nIf you didn't, this will be everything you never knew you wanted and more.", "timestamp_created": 1706017819, "timestamp_updated": 1706017819, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156621399": {"recommendationid": "156621399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198177925741", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2466, "playtime_at_review": 8463, "last_played": 1707746164}, "language": "english", "review": "i always thought dnd was cringe\n\n141 hours later i do not agree with my previous assessment anymore", "timestamp_created": 1706010862, "timestamp_updated": 1706010862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156611883": {"recommendationid": "156611883", "author": {"steamid": "76561199040105984", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4721, "playtime_at_review": 4649, "last_played": 1707725977}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely fantastic.

Exquisitely written and flawlessly executed in the game, indeed. They have their own personality, their own archs, and they have you as means of their salvation or doom. You rise and fall with them, you lead them towards the favorable ending, or a catastrophe. Or you just kill them straight away. Yes, you can do that too.\nYOU form this world, it's YOU who decides what happens next and it is YOU who faces the consequences of those decisions.\n\nWhat Larian created is an immersive world full of encounters, full of problems with some requiring a solution, and full of small decisions which might, or might not matter in the long run. It's exactly what I would've expected from a world that is supposed to feel [i]actually alive[/i]. The amount of things you can do AND HOW you can get to do them in this game is crazy. \n\nWant to play as a generally good guy? Go for it!\nWant to be aligned more towards the neutral side of things? Boring, but you can!\nWant to be an absolute menace to everyone, including your peers? Godspeed, and you can find companions who think alike!\nWant to ruin absolutely everything you touch, every relationship you make, and every encounter you might've positively solved, right afterwards? I was shocked that you can do even that.\n\nThe best thing about this game is that it allows you to do EVERYTHING. Yes, you can use a child's corpse as an improvised weapon. Yes, it's questionable, but you can do it - how you get it in the first place is best kept under the lid. Yes, you can wipe out an entire village and the world won't break; instead it will actually react to your actions.\n\nThis game deserves all the praise it got. It offers an amazing experience with huge replayability, guaranteeing hundreds of hours spent in the world either alone or with friends via co-op - all that and you'll [b]most likely[/b] still find things you haven't encountered in the last 150 hours, for example.\n\n[u][b]Strongly recommended to buy for a full price - they deserve it after delivering a game that has set a great example for other studios to follow.[/b][/u]", "timestamp_created": 1705877844, "timestamp_updated": 1706212458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156488869": {"recommendationid": "156488869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102982255", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 6407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 350, "playtime_at_review": 5586, "last_played": 1707635457}, "language": "english", "review": "i was so unfortunately charmed by THAT wizard i dont know what this says about me", "timestamp_created": 1705861738, "timestamp_updated": 1705861738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156488154": {"recommendationid": "156488154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013400172", "num_games_owned": 519, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 541, "playtime_at_review": 5830, "last_played": 1707792083}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeah it's good", "timestamp_created": 1705861150, "timestamp_updated": 1705861150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156486729": {"recommendationid": "156486729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217944616", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 1366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 600, "playtime_at_review": 249, "last_played": 1706969008}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1705859952, "timestamp_updated": 1705859952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156484903": {"recommendationid": "156484903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001363421", "num_games_owned": 623, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 4999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4654, "last_played": 1706393814}, "language": "english", "review": "By far one of the best PC games I've ever played.

This game is more than a mere sequel; it's a triumph in video game storytelling, a breakthrough in RPG mechanics (probably more than 100 ways of just doing the Goblin Camp), and a dazzling spectacle of fantasy world-building.\n\nThe first thing that strikes you about Baldur's Gate 3 is its stunningly detailed world. Every environment is a work of art, teeming with hand-crafted details and intricate lore. Whether you're exploring the Underdark or the city itself, the game's world is so immersive that you can't help but feel part of its history and future.\n\nCharacter customization and development are where Baldur's Gate 3 really shines. The range of races, classes, and backgrounds available allows for countless unique character builds. Your party members are not just fighters; they are characters with their own stories, beliefs, and personalities, making every interaction meaningful.\n\nTechnically, the game is a marvel. The graphics are breathtaking for a crpg, the voice acting is top-notch, and the soundtrack is both haunting and beautiful. The attention to detail in every aspect of the game's design and execution is evident.\n\nThere are definitely some bugs in Act 3 but Larian has done an excellent job patching them. I also highly recommend Honor Mode once you learn the game, with the golden dice being an excellent prize.\n\nAbsolutely recommend it.

"review": "I very rarely write reviews for games, but here we go.\n\nI always figured I'd never experience the same 'feeling' playing a cRPG as I did when playing Dragon Age: Origins on release. Mostly because I figured nostalgia probably played a huge part in my fondness for the game.\n\nHowever, I felt the same sense of giddy excitement I felt then while playing BG3. I was, once again, like a kid experiencing their first big Triple A title. Baldur's Gate 3 is truly a gem of a game and is crafted by a team that is passionate about not only weaving a compelling narrative with characters that could truly be real people but also about designing game play that  keeps surprising the player after of hundreds of hours.\n\nBG3 allows the player an insane amount of agency in approaching conversations, fights, big arc defining moments, and sometimes you can mess up so badly you contemplate reloading because you're dumbfounded at just how terribly something turned out.\n\nThe game is massive and filled to the brim with content! Even after, what I thought was, two incredibly detailed play throughs, I still found things I'd never run across before in subsequent games. And that's just playing the Dark Urge Origin & the default Tav. BUT THEN, you can play as companion Origin characters and see whole new sets of dialogue and scenarios you'd never experience with the default character. \n\nWhile no game is 100% perfect, BG3 comes pretty damn close, in my opinion. From narrative, to combat, to class design, to  the voice acting, it hits every note near perfect. I could probably wax on forever about the talent of the entire VA cast, but I won't, beyond saying everyone gave their all for these characters.\n\nSo BRAV-freaking-O, Larian, for making BG3 my new standard for RPGs. I have a feeling nothing will come even close for a long, long time.\n\nPS: No game is for everyone, and if its not your cup of tea, that's okay. :)", "timestamp_created": 1705613359, "timestamp_updated": 1705613359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156256366": {"recommendationid": "156256366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198375318819", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 9291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2335, "playtime_at_review": 3808, "last_played": 1707786196}, "language": "english", "review": "best game ever", "timestamp_created": 1705613028, "timestamp_updated": 1705613028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156254905": {"recommendationid": "156254905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198290117189", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 142, "last_played": 1705619708}, "language": "english", "review": "HAHAHAHA GAME", "timestamp_created": 1705611196, "timestamp_updated": 1705611196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156254669": {"recommendationid": "156254669", "author": {"steamid": "76561199588396880", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 462, "last_played": 1705616160}, "language": "english", "review": "its super fun and simple to use/ navigate even for beginners like myself.", "timestamp_created": 1705610892, "timestamp_updated": 1705610892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156254630": {"recommendationid": "156254630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296194711", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 15349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4002, "playtime_at_review": 9572, "last_played": 1707797861}, "language": "english", "review": "This game slaps\n\nIt's got Electrolytes & more.", "timestamp_created": 1705610839, "timestamp_updated": 1705610839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156253861": {"recommendationid": "156253861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046473642", "num_games_owned": 369, "num_reviews": 107, "playtime_forever": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 281, "last_played": 1705619699}, "language": "english", "review": "Just killed a Twink Vampire and Gamora", "timestamp_created": 1705609933, "timestamp_updated": 1705609933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156253756": {"recommendationid": "156253756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799335837", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 4586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1375, "playtime_at_review": 3077, "last_played": 1707698668}, "language": "english", "review": "I've never played a game like this before so I had no clue what I was doing at first, but I've sort of got the hang of it now and it's SUPER fun.

I came from early access and stopped playing somewhere around patch 3 or 4 of early access. I felt that the game was way too buggy and had next to no content.  I knew a lot more was going to come out in the future, but I was a skeptic.  At the time, I was enjoying Divinity 2 and felt that this game was lacking in freedom during combat.  Now, I have completed the story twice, and am working on an honour mode completion.  I believe that the game was made with true care and love and that the game play is both immersive and fantastic.\n\nEveryone who worked on this game must have had a blast, since every aspect of this game seems to have been made with love and with player creativity in mind.  Like the tabletop game it is based off of (D&D), the game allows for many creative solutions to each problem.  Having trouble with a boss? Try shoving it off the edge for a quick win.  While this tactic loses on grabbing that sweet loot, it is one of the many tactics that can be used to accomplish your goals.  In one part of Act I, there is a particular goblin, whose interactions with you change based on your race and build.  You also can choose to deal with this npc in various other ways.  This extends to every aspect of this game, and it never feels like the game forces you to do something a specific way.\n\nMoreover, your choices matter.  Killing an npc early on will have real consequences down the line, and finishing a quest line may reward you with unique endings or access to better loot all the way in Act 3.  This game is far from the TellTale classic, \"Astarion will remember this.\" and actually makes you feel like you can have an impact on this world.  The voice acting, dialogue, and animations all lend themselves to making the characters feel real and relatable.  You want to help the people in this world, and playing the villain always feels terrible.\n\nFinally, combat in this game is quite amazing.  At first, it feels like a slug fest, where no one really does too much to each other, and many rounds are spent dashing and chasing each other down.  As the game progresses, you learn how to use this combat system to your advantage.  You learn what builds are really strong when an enemy pummels your entire party, and what builds are weak when your rogue druid ranger multi-class build can't make anything happen (I am determined to run this in 5e).  I will say, that you will have an advantage if you have played D&D before, as the system used in this game is quite similar, maybe even easier for PCs.\n\nOverall, although my expectations were abysmally low, I was surprised with how much I enjoyed this game.  I am sure I will be playing this game for years, and I am also sure that I have only scratched the surface.", "timestamp_created": 1705471549, "timestamp_updated": 1705471549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156148666": {"recommendationid": "156148666", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121068241", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4277, "last_played": 1706031691}, "language": "english", "review": "Karlach is best girl", "timestamp_created": 1705466459, "timestamp_updated": 1705466459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156142314": {"recommendationid": "156142314", "author": {"steamid": "76561199056364578", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1556, "last_played": 1699241266}, "language": "english", "review": "it is good but please add sex.\n\nEDIT: Ok nevermind.", "timestamp_created": 1705456445, "timestamp_updated": 1705456445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156142059": {"recommendationid": "156142059", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032527518", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 16466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 16405, "last_played": 1707084515}, "language": "english", "review": "game is good", "timestamp_created": 1705456010, "timestamp_updated": 1705456010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156141178": {"recommendationid": "156141178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198344759139", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 11268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 989, "playtime_at_review": 7780, "last_played": 1707787735}, "language": "english", "review": "Game lets you fuck a humanoid octopuss, 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1705454589, "timestamp_updated": 1705454589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156139323": {"recommendationid": "156139323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034550714", "num_games_owned": 335, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5654, "last_played": 1705629516}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2595\u2594\u2572\n\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u258f\u2595\n\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u258f\u2595\u2582\u2582\u2582\n\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2571\u2508\u2595\u2582\u2582\u2582\u258f\n\u2589\u2589\u2589\u2589\u2589\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2595\u2582\u2582\u2582\u258f\n\u2589\u2589\u2589\u2589\u2589\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2595\u2582\u2582\u2582\u258f\n\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2572\u2582\u2595\u2582\u2582\u2582I", "timestamp_created": 1705451741, "timestamp_updated": 1705451897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156138723": {"recommendationid": "156138723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038862977", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 11210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10821, "last_played": 1705618476}, "language": "english", "review": "It's hard to compare with anything I've ever played.

This might've been alleviated if I hadn't gone so completionist on the first playthrough, but it feels like the game spreads itself too thin in Act III. Bugs are one thing, but it's very late to be introducing so many plot arcs, and I think that dev effort could've better gone towards improving the depth of companion stories and the quest chains for the main antagonists. \n2.)

Played over the course of the last month, and hard to think of many other games that brought up so many emotions since a long time. This is such an incredible way to tell a story of this scale. \n\nI want to review all 3 Acts, as there seems to be a lot of opinions about how they differentiate. But before that, I will give one 'fair warning', and probably my only negative point:\n\n\nCOMBAT SYSTEM\nThe D&D turn based strategy combat system is really not for everyone. I personally love it, but even then, it's akward to play on a controller (yes, I didn't want to sit at my desk playing this, much happier playing it on my couch :D). The first 10 hours of the game were challenging to get a grasp of all the mechanics and how to optimize my battles. It wasn't just the combat itself, but the way your actions and spells organize themselves automatically without making much sense. It become messy quickly when you have a class with lot of abilities, and you regularly need to re-organise your ability slots. I don't understand why the game wouldn't automatically separate ability radials in categories 'Physical Dmg, Magical Dmg, Support Abilities' as default.\n\nAnyway, it was only after 5-10 hours that I eventually looked for a tutorial online for optimizing your play through with controller, and that eventually changed completely how I enjoyed the game in a very positive way. \n\n\nSTORY\nThe strength of this game for me, is just the depth of storytelling. It is brilliant, outstanding and I think there are enough reviews out there for me not to spend time on it. So here is how I personally experienced each acts. Most of it is SPOILER FREE, and has spoiler warnings.\n\n\nACT I: \nThe pure joy of discovering BG3's lore right there. I couldn't find any flaws in this act besides the lack of tutorials. I purposely chose to play this Act without exploring all the areas, because the way the encounters guided me through the story felt so organic that I didn't feel I was missing anything really, and that if I played again, I'll experience something new. For example, I played this Act without encountering Astarion. No regrets whatsoever. I got to build a party with Shadowheart/Karlach/Wyll - and bring some other companions in my camps along the way. What a pure joy this act was.\n\nThere was a simplicity to it that I loved, Quests felt all worthy of being considered, and choices felt very organic and impactful! I also picked up and read every lore book I could find. It is just such an amazing adventure start for loremongers, and sets so many little things in motions for you to experience later in the game!\n\n\nACT II:\nProbably my favorite story arch of the game. Without spoiling, Shadowheart has such a great narrative - and this act is full of great moments for her. But overall, the tragedies and darkness of this act are so poignant, the combats are meaningful, and the results of ending it felt really 'worth it' as far as story goes.\n\nHowever, this is where I started getting my first taste of narrative inconsistencies. Nothing crazy, but some NPC interactions made little sense, and triggering certain quests before talking to a character about it, felt kind of inorganic. I also felt a lack of 'choices' at times. Nothing major though.\n\nSPOILER: Lifting the Shadow curse felt inorganic. I couldn't find the right interaction to trigger in order to complete it - and yet, it's reminded so much by NPCs that it felt soooo important not to ignore, and had to cheat this one before leaving ACT II. Only quest I looked for solution online.\n\n\nFinally, I would love for the game to close access to areas of ACT I as soon as you enter ACT II. I didn't explore all of ACT I areas, and ended up exploring the mountain pass during ACT II in a way which made not much sense at this point of the story. Kind of ruined the immersion for me.\n\n\nACT III: \nA controversial act when checking reviews - but to me, such an EPIC one. The issue with this act in my opinion is that there is too much to do. Act I had such an organic storytelling, and you feel Act 3 tried to achieve the same but x10, which can give at time a lot of inconsistencies and confusion.\n\nPersonally, it was more the first part of act III which annoyed me. It had really distracting and unnecessary quest lines which made me spend so much time in Rivington trying to find meaning to it all, meaning which was not there at all, but actually beyond the bridge which was blocked. \n\nOnly when I passed the bridge did I feel a sense of wonder again, away from helping delivery pigeons and looking for clown body parts... But never did an NPC tell me that I should go there. They mention various areas of Baldurs Gate, but don't tell you in which direction to go.\n\nAnd so, I felt lost in my first 10 hours of ACT III, exploring right and left corners looking for things which felt important but weren't. Guards wouldn't let me pass the bridge without arresting me even when Disguised. Just took it as an incentive to explore more, and while there are some nice stuff to discover, they really don't all feel necessary. Eventually just decided to turn invisible only to discover that passed them is where Act III really starts to unfold.\n\nWyrming Crossing is really what I hoped Rivington would be. That's where you set the pieces for the overall Baldurs Gate Arch. And it's really good. Why make me waste so much time in Rivington?\n\n\nThe biggest area of ACT III is truly a town of Epic proportion. Lot of great story moments in my opinion, and enough choices that build up on how you want to end the game. In many moments, I truly thought twice about what I wanted to do exactly. However, again, some useless side quests felt distracting at some point, keeping me away from what truly mattered.\n\nSPOILER: I don't understand why with a game this big, you still have to prompt a quest to clear rats in a basement, from a guy you just told was going to be assassinated. Do I look like an exterminator really? With all that bloodied gear I wear? Can't you give me another meaningful reason to go the the basement?\n\n\nOverall, there are quite a few dialogue inconsistencies depending on which order you decide to explore ACT III. These inconsistencies, bring lack of depth in some choices, creating unfortunately a need to 'save scum' the game before any important interaction, and the reason is simply because some choices felt kind of unclear. And they can have such an impact on the story.\n\nBut, it's something you have to learn to live with. The act III is so rich in side quests that make the outcome of saving Baldurs Gate really worth it. Overall a really great experience, but I would love to 'trim some of the fat' when it comes to unnecessary interactions that may seem important, but really aren't.", "timestamp_created": 1705410382, "timestamp_updated": 1705410382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156094912": {"recommendationid": "156094912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054337898", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 51, "playtime_at_review": 79, "last_played": 1706810823}, "language": "english", "review": "Baldur's Gate 3 has left an indelible mark on my gaming experience, a feat only achieved by a handful of titles throughout the years.

You don't notice time passing and you realize it's the middle of the night and you're still eating that damn dragon in Wyrmway. So where do I start?\n\nI'll start with the enchanting voice of [b]Amelia Tyler[/b], without whom I just can't imagine BG3. And that's probably what the crust of this cake is soaked in. It is the very first 'character' of the game that you meet and that stays with you till the very end regardless of your fate. The voice... \ud83d\udc9c\n\nAll, absolutely all of the characters are so well-developed and charismatic that they seem real. It's the cream that binds each of the layers of the acts together. After all, your companions become a real family. I would especially like to recognize the work of actors [b]Neil Newbon[/b] (Astarion) and [b]Devora Wilde[/b] (Lae'zel). Their work was done just grandiose and it was their voice work that gave the characters incredible charisma.\n\nWhat really amazes me is that adventure awaits the player LITERALLY at every turn! Seriously, you can turn a corner or walk into a small store and you're already involved in another adventure! Delicious! Or... Very tasty mhahaha! \n\nI would also point out the deep elaboration of the world and game mechanics, as well as the developers' loyalty to the gaming community.\nYou can't handle the boss? Here are some options and the boss is overthrown!\nWant to change the appearance or class of the character? Easy, you can even change the gender if you want to.

Dad's friend got stuck somewhere in Baldur's Gate 1 and couldn't proceed, so he brought the entire PC + monitor to our house, which was hundreds of kilometers from his house, and left it with us for a few weeks to see if my brother and I could solve it. We couldn't (I was too young and brother had little interest), so instead we installed other games b/c his PC was way better than ours and enjoyed those games haha. But yeah, this is the passion people have about Baldur's Gate games.\n\nPPS: I played for way longer than 18.5 hours, but before Mac version released I launched the executable directly from CrossOver and not via Steam client.

You proceed to find three guys and another woman with the same symbiote problem as yourself and begin looking for a solution to that problem. That's all I'm revealing of the story just so you know what to expect initially, because everything else is best experienced blindly. Having beaten the game once, I can't think of an uninteresting story component anywhere. This game is masterfully written.\n\nGameplay is top-down, point-and-click, turn-based tactical role-playing. The outcome of combat actions, object interactions and certain dialogue choices are determined by the game rolling 20-sided dice - the number the dice need to match or beat is higher the harder the action is, and the skill being tested is added to whichever number you get. If this kind of system sounds familiar, you've either played tactical role-playing games before, or you've played Dungeons and Dragons, which very likely is an inspiration to whichever tactical RPG's you've played. The story, in fact, takes place in the DnD universe. Does this mean that you need to be a DnD player to enjoy BG3? No. \n\nThe user interface is generally easy, although the inventory window takes some time to learn properly. Camera controls allow you to either move the view around freely (except not upwards or downwards) or keep the camera centered on the character you're controlling at the moment.\n\nThe graphics are brilliant. More importantly, they're well optimized - I'm running the game on a PC that just about meets the minimum requirements, and getting a smooth and pretty experience on graphics settings above the minimum. This game has Bethesda seething.\n\nThe soundtrack is a great mix of intense orchestral combat music and meditative fantasy ambience. Combined with atmospheric and charismatic narration and brilliant voice acting - one of the actors pulled home 2023's voice acting award at the Game Awards - resulting in peak immersion.\n\nMy last point is one we rarely get reasons to talk about in this age of launch-day DLC's, lootboxes, subscriptions and pay-to-win schemes. This game has an *insane* lot and depth of *content*, and a rarely seen degree of replayability. You're finally getting what you pay for.\n\nIn conclusion, this game pulling home 6 wins on the 2023 Game Awards wasn't the result of someone getting blown.

this game a VERY solid 9/10. 100% recommend you buy this if you do not already own it, and just 1/3 of the game itself is worth full price. And trust me, this is one of those games you want to take your time with. Really envelop yourself in its world, or you're doing yourself and the game a great disservice. YOUR CHOICES MATTER, this is not a pseudo butterfly effect, nor illusion of choice. Your actions have SEVERE consequences even towards the end of the game where you least expect.\n\nIf somehow you are someone who is yet to acquire this game; I implore you to stop considering and just make the purchase. I personally went in doubting I was going to enjoy it, mostly influenced by some friends to give it a shot- and boy am I glad I kept going with it. \n\nBaldurs Gate 3, in a vacuum is an incredible roleplaying adventure with heavy DnD influence. The voice cast, the art team, hell the programmers all did such an incredible job giving the game, its characters, and the world such life and personality. \n\nI will make mention of course, that there will be bugs. There may be run-ending bugs. This is something you just have to expect unfortunately with a project with such a large scope. Does it suck knowing you could lose 50+ hours of your time because of a stupid coding conflict? Of course.

The love that the creators, developers, actors, directors, authors, et al. put in is deep and it is palpable. Such an intricate RPG has given me the unique experience of learning more about myself and who I am. I am grateful for that.\n\nYou will experience all manner of emotion playing this game, the story and the world suck you in effortlessly. The sheer number of things you can do would seem overwhelming if it weren't for their very, very clever placement of hidden stories, areas, and quests. I have still not found everything after multiple campaigns and over 300 hours of playing. There is a lot that is easy to overlook, and that makes it all the more satisfying when you do discover something or figure it out.\n\nThis was my first time properly playing a turn-based RPG, at first I was unsure but as I played more it's become almost an addictive form of chess! Each battle differs significantly enough that I have to think carefully and consider my strategy. It is even fun to go back and replay battles immediately just to see if you could have done something more efficiently. In most games, after defeating a difficult boss or battle, I have no desire to immediately replay it.\n\nThe life that the authors and actors gave these characters is unlike anything I have ever seen. They are complex, full, well-rounded people who are not simply morally black or white (or even just simply on a scale) -- everyone has their own idiosyncrasies and unique views of the world, just like real people.

Instead, it stars a cast of wonderfully written and voice-acted companions as well as other characters with actual personality and volition.

This game quite literally has all the pitfalls of their [i]Divinity[/i] games (limp, bargain-bin main plot, crammed and claustrophobic level design, trigger-happy AI, force-dialogues, pandering, etc.) and it's befuddling that so many are inclined to write these flaws off. Is [i]BG3[/i] a decent game? Sure, it's fun to play. Is [i]BG3[/i] a 96% Metacritic game? No.\n\nNow, I ain't gonna pass judgment because I prefer the frenzied, life-or-death fights that the RtwP classics had bestowed upon us \u2013 that subject was exhausted years ago \u2013 but rather I'll try to look at this game as objectively as possible \u2013 while also taking into account that much better RPGs like [i]Disco Elysium[/i] exist.\n\nSo here's my review after 200+ hours (1 EA playthrough, 1 Tav playthrough, 1 Durge playthrough):\n\n[h1][b]PROS:[/b][/h1]\n[list]\n[*] The combat system is solid and the boss fights are really fun (shout-out goes to my boy Raphael and the House of Grief for catching me with my pants down). The final fight, though, is the exception (see below). \n[*] Huge scope, high production value, and lots of content with well-animated cutscenes. Voice-acting for your companions is top-notch too, in particular Astarion and Karlach. The side characters' voice-acting is a bit more of a mixed bag (see below).\n[/list]\n\n[h1][b]CONS:[/b][/h1]\n[b]FLAWS[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The writing is... not engaging. The main plot is so trite and predictable that you'll be groaning out loud at all the plot holes and straight-out previous [i]Baldur's Gate[/i] games/Forgotten Realms lore retcons. It's filled to the brim with contrived coincidences, incomprehensible motivations, a clich\u00e9 sticky MacGuffin, an inscrutable force that makes you its Chosen One, and genre blind cretins for enemies \u2013 by the Nine Hells, just *search* Tav and the party and you'll find that stupid artifact! \u2013 and as a result, the pacing feels like \u201cLook at this! Now look at that! Hehe, there's a HAT!\u201d Sure, the game tries to excuse all of the above by stating that [spoiler]the Netherbrain had planned everything from the start[/spoiler], but this lame quote-unquote 'twist' comes in the last ten minutes of the game. And the fact [spoiler]the Netherbrain[/spoiler], despite all that glorious build-up, goes down in two turns makes the whole thing feel anticlimactic at best and unbelievably disappointing at worst.\n[*] While still on the subject of writing, all of the returning characters [i]BG 1[/i] and [I]2[/i] feel like last-minute additions only here to pacify the \u201c[i]BG3[/i] ain't got nothing connecting it to [i]BG 1[/i] and [I]2[/i]!\u201d crowd. [spoiler]Viconia and Sarevok[/spoiler] got absolutely freakin' shafted: both of them got reduced to one-dimensional shades of their former selves. And the fact that Larian didn't hire their original VAs perplexes me: Grey DeLisle/Griffin and Kevin Michael Richardson are still very active in the industry (see: Amazon's 'Invincible'), but here they got inexplicably replaced. What, did Larian blow their entire voice-acting budget on Omni-Man, Satan, and Lady Dimitrescu?\n[*] All of your companions, despite hailing from different corners of the planes, feel paradoxically indistinguishable. Why? Because every single one of them has a stock tragic backstory/trauma that you've got to sort out like you're their therapist.\n[*] The guard AI is so trigger-happy that it ain't even funny. You'll be accused (even by your allies!) of being in a restricted area or \u201cvandalizing\u201d property because its owner had just destroyed that same property with an errant AoE spell. The Harpers in Act 2 and Gortash's robots and Temple of Bhaal sycophants in Act 3 come to mind here very vividly.\n[*] The soundtrack is bland and forgettable; it's almost like the composer's heart wasn't in it. The only three good songs (Nine Blades, Harpy Song, and Raphael's Final Act) play once. Once! Larian, please, I'm begging you: when you make a turn-based game, you gotta make more than two-and-a-half good fight themes! I don't want to listen to the same boom-boom tune over and over again, especially when some of the fights take up to 30 minutes to finish.\n[*] [spoiler]Bhaalist[/spoiler] Durge ending. \u201cIn [spoiler]Bhaal's[/spoiler] name!\u201d followed by credits and exit to the main menu. What in the unholy blazes of Baator did I just witness? Makes the whole evil playthrough (or just the [spoiler]\u201cdominate the brain\u201d choice \u2013 the plot happened because some schmucks decided to dominate the brain[/spoiler]) feel like a waste of time.\n[/list]\n\n[b]NITPICKS[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The game has way too much signposting. Yes, flashing warning lights at the point of no return is important, but every major plot beat first gets thoroughly expounded to you by the relevant party after which you will *always* get a summary of what was just said. Gortash info-dumping (about his super-duper evil plan in front of a crowd that's about to elect him Grand Duke, no less \u2013 so long, Lady Immersion!) only for his speech to be vomited back at you by the Narrator/Dream Guardian sold this one for me. These ICYMI summaries happen a whole lot in Act 3.\n[*] Level design consists of twisted corridors. Normally, they serve their purpose, but the number of times I had to fight the camera that refused to let me target an enemy standing on the high ground was maddening.\n[*] Far too many redundant out-of-combat skill checks. Roll a DC 7 to see that there's a body under the bed when you're inches away from that bed? A character native to Faer\u00fbn rolling to think of some of the major gods' portfolios? Really?\n[*] Despite the game giving you the option of making a non-binary character, making your character anything but cis will backfire. Spectacularly and quickly. Choosing they/them pronouns leads to all of the NPCs referring to you by what you've got in your pants. Which... naturally, ain't a good look for inclusivity. RIP my transmasc Durge \u2013 she/her'ed till of end of their days.\n[/list]\n\nTo wrap this up: if you don't care about anything else other than the gameplay/combat system, you can get [i]BG3[/i] and have a blast, but if you're looking for a compelling main/side stories and dice rolls that aren't as superfluous, play [i]Disco Elysium[/i].", "timestamp_created": 1705962849, "timestamp_updated": 1705962849, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518707513809204102", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158204670": {"recommendationid": "158204670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126055686", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 6360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 575, "playtime_at_review": 6360, "last_played": 1707795215}, "language": "english", "review": "No need for me to tell you what you already know.

I love how easily immersed I became, because the game encourages you to stop and listen. Your choices do matter and can play a significant role in your outcome.

The fact that they went out their way (multiple) times to thank their consumers and audience, in a genuine manner, is something that these gaming dev studios need to take note of. They could've stopped with the original release- instead, they continue to update, listen to their consumers, and continuously express appreciation. Yes the game has some bugs, but Larian Studios makes me (and others) confident that they will always find ways to elevate Baldur's Gate 3 and their future endeavors.  No surprise they won multiple awards, and I'm sure the title (and future projects) will follow suit, if they take note in what they achieved with BG3.\n\nThis is how you create and garner a committed, loyal and loving audience.

Everything honestly has been said! But the game has an incredible replay value, the voice and mocap is the best i've seen in a game, and the story is engaging, though it's peak feels different for everyone. It's been the first game in a long while I get that excited feeling in the stomach before going home to play, like I did when I was younger. It's definitely an experience that cannot be provided by numbers alone. The technical achievements are there, 100%, but everything comes together in a cohesive experience like nothing in recent memory. You can play the game in any way you wish, and a failure in speech is only a failure on paper. It fits the dnd mold that way. The game still continues, the story still stretches. And there is a very specific part in a story where by being true to my character, the outcome had a more valued affect than forcing a persuasive check that just wouldn't happen.

The storytelling is fantastic, immersing me in a world where every decision feels impactful. I'm constantly obsessed by the \"what-ifs\" of the choices I make (I save scum few times lol), and I love how the game allows for results/answers ranging from the utterly silly to the cunningly clever.The character creation is a highlight for me. It's as if I'm crafting my own fantasy avatar, embodying my ideal persona in BG/D&D world. The depth of options is surprising, especially with mods that expand the possibilities to seemingly no limit.Admittedly, the game had its share of bugs at launch, but the developers were quick to fix these issues day by day and week by week after release. By the time I reached Acts 2 and 3, most major problems had either been resolved or significantly minimized.the narrator (Amelia Tyler) & the voice acting for me is simply perfection. The quality of the voice work elevates the entire experience; without it, I will NEVER play BG3 and simply will watch the game on Twitch rather than playing it myself.After spending 180 hours to 1.5 playthroughs lol, my conclusion is clear BG3 is an absolute must-try (or must-have) game. Its immersive world, engaging choices, and exceptional voice acting make it a standout title in the CRPG genre and GOTY and game of the generation if I can say so myself.\n=============================\nGameplay: 8\nSound Design: 8 \nVoice Acting: 10\nMusic: 8\nVisuals and Environment: 9\nStory: 9", "timestamp_created": 1705391122, "timestamp_updated": 1705391122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157481462": {"recommendationid": "157481462", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111770213", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 112, "playtime_at_review": 839, "last_played": 1706956165}, "language": "english", "review": "Just go read a good fantasy book instead. \n\nMicromanagement hell 1/10 gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1706957430, "timestamp_updated": 1706957430, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518371105194091797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156142393": {"recommendationid": "156142393", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142406236", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2340, "playtime_at_review": 3053, "last_played": 1707789147}, "language": "english", "review": "My hot devil boyfriend shoots lasers, 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1705456578, "timestamp_updated": 1705456578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518324613571166992", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156811091": {"recommendationid": "156811091", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987226180", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1132, "playtime_at_review": 4259, "last_played": 1707774834}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly, one of the best games ever created.", "timestamp_created": 1706213453, "timestamp_updated": 1706213453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518248140811920166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157986736": {"recommendationid": "157986736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198827249555", "num_games_owned": 245, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 84, "last_played": 1703357040}, "language": "english", "review": "I understand the appeal and totaly get why people love this game, but man\nhonestly this is too slow for me, and I do not like the combat at all\nAgain I can see this game was crafted with passion -

However, I want to closely examine the details of the game to articulate my opinion.\n\nFirstly, companions, villains, supporting characters, and cameos\u2014all are amazing. Starting with companions, the most memorable and well-written for me were Astarion, Shadowheart, Karlach, Gale, and Wyll, each with a unique quest that significantly affects the main story, especially Shadowheart, Lae\u2019zel, and Gale. However, the best companion quest belongs to Astarion, firstly because of his charisma and secondly due to the significant dramatic effect the decision at the end of his quest brings upon him. Nonetheless, all characters are not only fantastic to play in a party with but also interesting to chat with, learning their stories and feelings about the situations in the game.\n\nVillains, on the other hand, have fewer memorable characters, but those that are memorable overshadow others. For example, my favorite villains were the pragmatic but charming devil Raphael and the leader with the most tragic backstory, General Ketheric Thorm. They were not only voiced wonderfully but also left a lasting impact on me in both playthroughs\u2014Raphael provided the most memorable fight in the game and pleased me every time he showed up, suggesting cooperation in various ways. Ketheric, on the other hand, demonstrated how broken a man can be in this world, making him the most relatable one among the Dead Three. Additionally, I must mention that on my second playthrough (Resisting Dark Urge), Orin had many new lines and cool dialogue, making him one of the best villains for this path.\n\nThere are also cameo characters that can be your allies or foes. For example, possible companions are the old veterans of Baldur's Gate\u2014Minsk and Jaheira. For me, they were just okay, nothing special. However, there were two villain cameos, Sarevok Anchev and Viconia DeVir. Viconia provided a challenging fight, but Sarevok, like Orin, had more lines and was voiced wonderfully. Every line from him filled me with dread, even though as a boss, he wasn't as challenging as Raphael or Viconia.\n\nSpeaking of supporting characters, some are memorable, such as Isobel, Dame Aylin, Emperor/Balduran, Orpheos, Volo, Yurgir, Mizora, Alfina (even though I met her only on the second playthrough on Dark Urge, so R.I.P. :( ), Sceleritas Fel, and many more were fun to talk to and help or not help in any matter.\n\nAnother thing I want to talk about is gameplay and immersion. Truth be told, initially, I didn't want to play BG3 because of the D&D-based combat. Still, after watching reviews and talking with my friends and colleagues who played it, I bought it, and it was my best purchase of 2023. I didn't understand the turn-based combat at first, but the immersion, lore, story, and interesting characters helped me overcome myself and appreciate the combat. After completing my first playthrough, I immediately started a new one, not only because of the combat but also for reasons I'll explain later in my essay.\n\nI would also like to mention that not only does the story have a huge variety of options, but so does the combat. There are 12 classes, even more subclasses and origins that stack up on each other, creating your own experience of how you want to play. I went for a Wizard/Sorcerer multiclass on my first playthrough, and it was amazing. The design of spells brought me joy, and the flexibility of different spells in battle was fantastic. My second playthrough as a Dark Urge Paladin was incredibly powerful. Maybe it was due to experience and knowledge of what to expect from different bosses, but my god, all bosses except Raphael, Viconia, and Nether Brain were decimated in 1-2 turns, with most of the damage coming from my Paladin tiefling beauty. I can't describe all the complexity of combat now, but I can assure you it would be enjoyable for fans and newcomers alike, like me.\n\nAlso, the attention to detail in the game and the quality of the quests show how people put their heart and soul into this game. There are no useless encounters, quests, or conversations in the game. After completing the game, I can say with a clear heart that every dialogue, every side quest is useful in its way. It is either vital to the story, gives you an amazing reward, is entertaining, or even all of the above. As someone with a keen interest in the video game industry and as a person studying to work in that industry, I was overwhelmed by this level of quality. All I can say is, \"Bravo Larian, masterclass work!\"\n\nThe story is a slightly weaker part than everything above due to a lack of drama in some parts. I am not saying it is bad\u2014no, it is good, very good, to be exact. However, a bit more drama in Act 2 or 3 would have made it masterful. Going back to the cliffhanger I left in the sentence above, one thing that made me replay the game was the story variety. Like mentioned before, every origin, class, subclass, decision, and relationship with companions affects the story differently. The only game I've played with this level of variety was Witcher 3, but Witcher couldn't even be compared to Baldur's Gate; that's how unimaginable it is. That's why it was more than worth it to play it for the second time. I explored places I hadn't been to in the first playthrough, completed quests I hadn't finished previously, and got a new ending. It made me tear up, not only because I got Karlach's ending but also because I knew this is it\u2014my adventure has come to an end. The main thing that stands above everything in this story is the real sense of an adventure, epic, full of amazing characters, and a lot of memorable moments.\n\nLastly, I want to talk about the soundtrack. Well, it is amazing, who would've thought. Borislav Slavov, singers, and the orchestra worked really hard to create such a pleasant soundtrack. Every piece of the game is accompanied by fitting and beautiful songs. My favorite songs throughout my two journeys were Raphael's Final Acts, The Legacy of Bhaal, I Want to Live, Down by the River, Song of Balduran, and many more.\n\nSo, this is by far the best game of the 2020 decade, the best gameplay experience of the year, and this magnificent journey with its amazing characters will be engraved in my mind for a long time. Hopefully, I will revisit this game in the upcoming years. I can give nothing less than the best mark for this game, for the astonishing work done to create this masterpiece RPG. You have my undying gratitude, Larian. \n10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1705880985, "timestamp_updated": 1705880985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516778528690338135", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156754623": {"recommendationid": "156754623", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969428769", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1492, "last_played": 1706156977}, "language": "english", "review": "This game isn't for everyone.

You could get 5 times the experience of bg3 for half the price.\n\nThe more I play this game, the more I realise problems with it. Immediately, I praise it for its incredibly lengthy and open story with multiple routes to take. By that aspect, I'm reminded of games like Detroit: Become Human and Undertale. The gameplay has quite a lot of issues with it, especially coming from the perspective of a TTRPG player. One of the biggest differences between a TTRPG and BG3 is that the game is not on your side at all. It's like having a DM that's trying to find every opportunity to screw you over. With how easy it is to accidentally make a mistake in this game, you're gonna want to quicksave every 5 minutes. That may seem like an exaggeration but that's being generous. For example, if you're playing a Paladin, the game doesn't make the Oaths clear and you could break your Oath with no clue you were doing so. If that happens, you better hope you hit F5 to quicksave or you're gonna need to do a lot of backtracking on an older save.\n\nOne thing I'm progressively realising, more and more, is that this game is built on its modding community. I was hesitant to try mods without completing the game, initially. Now that I've tried mods, I could never go back. The amount of quality of life that's completely overlooked and solved by mods is astonishing. The amount of content the mod makers have made for this game is truly incredible, too. \n\nThis is an absolutely phenomenal game, but the one thing pushing this down into a negative review for me is the price tag. There are other games out there that do what Baldur's Gate 3 do best for much cheaper. Detroit: Become Human is half the price, with a similarly impressive story and graphics. Heavy Rain is a quarter of the price. Undertale is roughly a tenth of the price with both its sequels being free. \n\nWhat pulls me back into this game is its story and sheer amount of options for customisation. Going through hours of content across 3 different acts several times as different races, classes or even with different motivations or party members makes this a unique experience every time. \n\nIf this game drops in price, buy it. It's phenomenal. Otherwise, if you want a rich story experience with multiple options, try Undertale, Deltarune, Detroit: Become Human, Heavy Rain or many other story and choice heavy games. If you want to experience the game's deep levels of customisation and the combat system, play a D&D fifth edition game with your friends. If you don't have friends but still crave that fifth edition experience, this is the perfect option.\n\nContext: This review was written on 07/02/2024.

I was reminded of the time where I had just rediscovered Skyrim and sank over 800 hours into it on my Switch or how - when I got Elden Ring - I spent entire nights sleepless, because I just could not put the game down. Baldur's Gate 3 did something similar to me, but even more intense.\nConstantly I feel the urge (hehe) to start a new character or reload a safe, because I want to see how a scenario might have turned out had I said something different or went another direction before heading to my objective. I want to hear all the companions' remarks and comments on my dialogue and actions, I want to cheese my way through combat or try it the traditional way, I want to rush through certain dungeons, but then slow down and take in every single minute detail of another. I want to explore, strategize, argue with myself over what choice to take in order to stay truest to my character while not fucking myself over. There are so many things I have in my mind at all times when playing BG3 and that is something no game has managed before to this exact degree.\n\nBut to go into more specifics - I love the companions. Astarion starting out as a sarcastic, whiny bitch and then slowly opening up over the progression of the story and making you understand why he's acting like he has throughout your journey. Shadowheart being all mysterious and broody and having problems opening up to you. Lae'zel being mostly just scared and resorting to what years of indoctrination have presented her as a safe haven. Wyll and Karlach both in the end just wanting to do what's right and so on and on.\nMinthara, Halsin, Jaheeira and Minsc are all also great followers, but ultimately less important than those named above - and I guess Gale's also there.\n\nAnd atop that the story is fucking magnificent and even works to incorporate literally any and all of the characters' backgrounds as very central parts to at least one part of the plot.\n\nThe combat is extremely fun as well as there are literally uncountable many ways to approach any encounter and do anything from blowing everything up, to stealthily taking enemies out one by one. \n\nAh, man- I don't know what else to say, cause at this point I'm just rambling and thinking of new shit to say, because there is just that much positive to say about the game, but I also don't want to blow this review out of proportion, so I'll end it here and tell LITERALLY EVERYONE to play this game, because it's the best to have ever come out during my life time in my opinion - and it's an enrichment to the entire gaming community and scene in general.\n", "timestamp_created": 1706753846, "timestamp_updated": 1706753846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516325414180755615", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157987254": {"recommendationid": "157987254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254935066", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 14798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2118, "playtime_at_review": 14798, "last_played": 1707482752}, "language": "english", "review": "it is not possible for me to recommend this game enough, probably the only game ive ever played that actually deserves a price of 90AUD. id say this game is a must-play and has an insane amount of content, a single play through is all you need to be happy with your money and time spent as it can net you about 70-120 hours of content on your first run. please play if you want to enjoy life", "timestamp_created": 1707559897, "timestamp_updated": 1707559897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129076480865479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156719408": {"recommendationid": "156719408", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963954046", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 6158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1586, "playtime_at_review": 4572, "last_played": 1707779176}, "language": "english", "review": "Game of the Year for a reason, buy it.

I suppose people are saying that when comparing it to a lot of the half-assed games other developers have released in recent years, but obviously that\u2019s not that high of a bar to surpass. It\u2019s a finished product with hours of content, sure, but apart from pretty cutscenes, good voice acting, and a few good moments in the story, BG3 doesn\u2019t really have a whole lot going for it. In terms of overall gameplay, quests, and story, the game is very janky, tedious, monotonous, and ultimately... mediocre. \n\nI won\u2019t talk much about the story to avoid spoilers. It\u2019s alright, but it\u2019s not anything to write home about. It seemed fairly derivative of Divinity: Original Sin 2\u2019s story, with basically the entirety of Act 1 seeming copied and pasted from DOS2\u2019s Act 1. You go down on a crashing ship, get saved by some otherworldly intervention, and then spend the rest of the sequence looking for a way to remove your [strike]source collar[/strike] Illithid tadpole. The similarities continue with the presence of an elusive Big Bad and its cult, an otherworldly and personal guide, and a surprise character from the lore who is now much different than before. Such similarities aren\u2019t inherently bad things- especially since plenty of stories are going to have the same overarching themes and conflicts- but BG3\u2019s story definitely seems like a case of \u201ccopying the homework then changing it to look different\u201d. Furthermore, the story starts feeling pretty rushed partway into Act 2, with all the buildup to a certain character tapering off to properly introduce other characters prevalent in Act 3 and then suddenly up the stakes of the situation. Given the way you progress through this game, though, the tonal shift falls flat given how you can dally along however long you want despite everything telling you how bad everything is and how you really have to hurry to save the world now.\n\nSpeaking of things feeling rushed, that 100% applies to all the romances in the game. There\u2019s very little buildup and chemistry to such a sudden payoff\u2026 even if you haven\u2019t been actively pursuing a relationship. It\u2019s honestly pretty funny, since it takes very little to go from having ordinary conversations with your companions to them suddenly confessing their love for you and wanting to bang. Hell, having consistent interactions with them isn\u2019t even required for that to happen: I\u2019m still laughing about how surprised Halsin seemed that I didn\u2019t reciprocate his feelings for me, saying that I \u201ctended to [his] needs at camp not as a host but as a lover\u201d\u2026 when I only talked to him like, five times, and ONLY for a couple of story-related quests, NEVER in a way even remotely flirtatious, and even AFTER I was already in a relationship with Shadowheart. Never even used the dude in my active party a single time!\n\nYour companions are probably the strongest part of the game. They all have interesting and enjoyable questlines and personalities, and it\u2019s fun seeing the way they react not only to you and your choices, but to each other while you\u2019re out adventuring. Even the companions I wasn\u2019t that interested in adventuring with seemed like solid characters, so there\u2019s certainly an aspect of replayability just to be able to get to know them and see their questlines through to the end. Unfortunately\u2026 that would involve playing the game again.\n\nBG3\u2019s gameplay is\u2026 not good. Dice rolls don\u2019t really translate well into video game format. It works in DnD and other tabletops because they\u2019re a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying experience. The DM or other players can always make your fails interesting, pick up on your slack, or, if worse comes to worst, find a way to bail you out. In game format, you're just fucked since the outcomes are predetermined, usually with a failure leading to combat or you just wasting your turn. Even succeeding at rolls isn\u2019t all that interesting, since again, the outcomes are predetermined, and usually just boil down to things like getting what you want, getting ignored while trespassing, or lowering the price of something. Not very interesting in the end even if it\u2019s satisfying seeing you passed the roll. \n\nCombat, especially when there are several enemies around, feels like such a slog, and sometimes even lags as if an NPC suddenly gained sentience and is deliberating on what action to take. Movement feels slow and limited, with there being multiple instances where a perfectly reachable space or enemy CAN\u2019T be reached just\u2026 because. You especially feel limited as a spellcaster, not because of limited spell slots, but because so many of your spells are niche and situational or concentration-based, which limits the kinds of spells you\u2019d even be willing to use. It\u2019s similar for your Feats as well; you only get to choose three of them in the entire game, and so many of them are, again, niche and inferior to other feats with clearer and broader upsides in their use. \n\nInventory management is a pain, especially with the overabundance of pointless items, potions, and scrolls you\u2019ll never need to use on a regular playthrough. Reminds me of why I only ever did Lone Wolf playthroughs in DOS2, because having to manage four clunky and cluttered inventories was a chore. The same applies to radial management for your skills and spells, at least if you\u2019re playing on controller.\n\nFinally, your choices and progression\u2026 Ultimately, it didn\u2019t really seem to matter much what I did. I really hate how often I could quickly find the solution to a problem or a particular quest only for the characters involved to talk or act as if I hadn\u2019t by giving me information I already knew about HOURS ago or saying that this or that thing needs to be done.

Now, we have so many unsatisfied players in the community because this NPC doesn't receive the same attention as another NPC.

So I would like to write a complete review of this game. Since the game has respected my time, I shall respect it with a review!!\n\nMy advice to anyone playing this game for the first time would be to watch 3 or 4 combat and/or tips and trick videos, stay away from viewing OP build guides (atleast for your first 2 playthroughs) and \nMOST IMPORTANTLY engage in writing out a background for your character, impose some restrictions on them, \"Eg: due to having their entire family killed by goblins, Tav has a hatred for goblins and prefers to kill them before even speaking to them\", stuff like that, I did it and I felt this improved my experience many fold.\n\nBut most importantly, all playstyles are viable and play it in your way, any way you like\n\nA) The Combat: \n\na) As this was my first CRPG I had a lot of problems with the combat. The tutorial IMO did not do enough for teaching me the basics of what spell saves are or difficulty class is or what is attack rolls and that it is different from damage rolls, etc.\nb) After maybe 50 hours into the game, the gameplay began to flow very well. You have so many different ways to defeat your foes, it is crazy. The best part is, apart from a few instances, whenever I thought up a new way to beat my enemies, it surprisingly worked!! Command them to drop their weapon, collect the dropped weapons and then watch as they helplessly try to hit you with their fist? Done. Put them in an AOE concentration spell, and make them unable to move and watch as they slowly suffocate to dead? Say no more. Become a wild beast and maul them to death? The lemons are there, squeeze them as hard as you want! \nc) The magic felt lacking in some aspects though, I felt there were too many concentration spells and not enough fire and forget spells. \nd) I have not yet played a melee character (unless you count an owlbear as one) so I cannot speak for them, but as a magic character, the game was pretty fun.\ne) I played my playthrough on tactitian difficulty and O boy, the game was challenging till the end! The difficulty is well paced. The fights were nail biting (unless you save scum) and every moment was a fun kind of challenge. I can say that, there are definite OP builds in the game, but I suggest you not look it up until you have beat the game atleast 2 times!\nf) The best part I liked about the combat is that your party of 4 is not special at all (I played my first playthrough denying the worm). Everyone in this game who is of the same level as you, has equal amount of power as you and wont hesitate to utilize powerful spells and tactics against you (except for maybe the rogues). It makes you feel that if you are careless in battle you or multiple teammates might fall.\ng) Carrying on from the last point, the death of your companions does not really feel special. There are so many ways to revive fallen heroes that death never felt like a threat, more of a disadvantage in the current combat situation. I really hope there is more weight to keeping teammates alive in the game, rather than just letting them die and reviving them.\nh) Dont worry about making the wrong choice in the character creator, all classes are viable and can be used to finish the game. Play your way and enjoy!!\n\nB) Story: (Does not contain side quests and character quests) \n\na) The story overall is a base \"Save the World\" story with a few twists, nothing very special, but nothing to scoff at either. The last act, ACT 3, dragged on and became boring for a bit, but towards the end the pace picks up again and you can feel the adrenaline rush as it did in the previous acts.\nb) The first Act was by far the best Act. They kept up the mystery throughout the first Act extremely well, and I could never have imagined there would be so much to do in this Act, and there is obviously more than meets the eye in the first act.\n\nCharacters \n\na) This is the segment, the game that shines the most in. Every character has their own motivations and decisions. You will feel like each character that joins you is looking out for their interests. They actually feel like living breathing humans (or whatever race they are). They chime in with their inputs in conversations, they dislike some of your actions and like others.\nb) Apart from your companions, the people who live in this world feel lively when first seeing them, obviously the charm dies a bit after hearing them for the 5th time, but it is really cool. The main city is bustling with people talking to others about their daily lives, how some adventurers dont want to live in a brothrel because other inns are occupied, how a gnome is being gifted a sex session from a brothel by his friends and how he is extremely shy about it. The world seems lived in and makes you want to save it all the more.\nc) Side quest Characters are not just quest givers. Often their fate is determined by what you do and sometimes you meet these people in later areas and it is a really pleasant surprise!\n\nWorld\n\na) The world has been built excellently. This I believe is another pillar of this game. The world is divided into acts and you cannot travel to Act 1 or Act 2 locations once you step into Act 3. Each world is massive and has a wealth of new discoveries to be made and surprises to be found if you look hard enough.\nb) The world changes you make are permanent, meaning anything that is looted will remain looted and anyone who is killed will remain killed. This makes you feel a sense of belonging to this world, when you go past a battleground, you are reminded of the fights you had there!\n\nAll in all, this game has been an excellent one and I no doubt will play more of this for many months to come, I really hope Larian releases modder resources like Bethesda and CDPR, so the talented modding community can build more amazing awesome stuff in an already amazing game. \nThis game has so much to offer and so many stories to tell that, this game truely cannot be finished after a single playthrough.\n", "timestamp_created": 1707647336, "timestamp_updated": 1707647336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505617976188659668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156657358": {"recommendationid": "156657358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171114901", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 12872, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12572, "last_played": 1706393192}, "language": "english", "review": "girl penice", "timestamp_created": 1706046675, "timestamp_updated": 1706046675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505617976188659668", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157157658": {"recommendationid": "157157658", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117100571", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 435, "playtime_at_review": 1201, "last_played": 1707623720}, "language": "english", "review": "Stop looking for a reason to not buy it, just buy it alreadyyyyyyy", "timestamp_created": 1706579072, "timestamp_updated": 1706579072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505494534969329834", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156097328": {"recommendationid": "156097328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091701111", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 14058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 515, "playtime_at_review": 13543, "last_played": 1707058676}, "language": "english", "review": "Rolled 20.", "timestamp_created": 1705412628, "timestamp_updated": 1705412628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505300343036651611", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156835471": {"recommendationid": "156835471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048046525", "num_games_owned": 1597, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 8596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 427, "playtime_at_review": 8014, "last_played": 1707454175}, "language": "english", "review": "I do not like this game and I am a hater", "timestamp_created": 1706239484, "timestamp_updated": 1706239484, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50519031286239624", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157883279": {"recommendationid": "157883279", "author": {"steamid": "76561199023470442", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6134, "playtime_at_review": 7154, "last_played": 1707797991}, "language": "english", "review": "Everything is absolutely flawless, except for a few things - the story is a bit shallow, it doesn't take any real risks, that being said, the story TELLING is great.\n\nAct 3 is a bit of a mess, quest markers are out of place, if they even exist at all, google is required. The final battle is hard, but not in a good way, in a cheesy way. With tons of immobility and stuns.

This game was a buggy, unstable mess of poor performance on 1.0 release, even on high end hardware. Some improvements and fixes have been made since then, but the game is still not in an acceptable release state. The state of this game is comparable to Cyberpunk 2077 in its launch window. I expected better from a game coming out of two years in Early Access.\n\nMy Steam hours played of 170 is deceptive, because my in-game save file is about half that at about 80 hours. There is not a quest, encounter, NPC, or party member that did not break or have significant issues during my run. In a single save file, I had to replay almost every second of this game. A quest or encounter or NPC interaction would break, and I was forced to reload a previous save. If that didn't fix the issue, I'd keep going back to earlier and earlier saves until I found one that wasn't yet bugged or with a branching path that worked. Many issues were never solved, and there were quests, plotlines, encounters and interactions I was unable to see through.\n\nAnd these issues are present from the very first moments of the game and throughout, not just in Act 3. In the current patch, many issues persist, and performance today remains poor on a range of hardware throughout the game.\n\nThat said, the character and class options are very impressive, and combat is a lot of fun. There is a very cool fantasy tactics game buried underneath its many issues.\n\nWait for this game to improve in performance and fix its bugs and glitches.

If you want a great story driven game - play Witcher 3. If you are nostalgic about Baldur's Gate games - play BG2. If you are in love with the great work of the voice actors - might be better to just watch YouTube videos with them.\n\nI think that the voice acting here is awesome. Could not agree more with the Astarion actor getting the Best Performance reward, other actors are hardly far behind. The eagles in the monastery are totally irrelevant for the plot and also have only a few lines, but that is a way better voice acting than many main characters have in games.\n\nI am also very glad to see an RPG game with so much funding. Hope, there are going to be other RPG games on the same level of funding. Unfortunately, there are plenty of issues.\n\n[b]Bugs[/b]. They are inevitable and, hopefully, they are going to be fixed. But right now bugs result in plot holes, in failed honor runs and in generally plenty of frustration. So worth mentioning.\n\n[b]Story issues[/b]. I assume that a lot of hype around the game is because of the fully voiced dialogues and the attached expectations of a great narrative and story. Maybe people think it is a new Witcher 3. Unfortunately, it is not. The story is good in act 1 and act 2. The second act could have been a great ending for the whole game. Unfortunately, there is act 3 with its dumber villains and unimaginative resolutions to the mysteries. The companion arcs are disappointing - as if the writers wanted some of them to suffer no matter what just because. The story conclusion of not being able to face the last boss without [spoiler]an illithid[/spoiler] doesn't have any real justification, feels like a forced utter garbage. The was no reason at all to use a prominent historical figure ([spoiler]Balduran[/spoiler]) the way they did, it serves no purpose. And do not forget the bugs that just deprive you of parts of the story through the whole game.\n\n[b]Bad designs[/b].\n[list]\n[*]Rests. The game wants you to rest. A lot. If you do not take long rests all the time, you miss parts of the story and won't be able to progress some quests. But the same time the game punishes you for resting - at the beginning it seems that you just won't have enough camp resources to rest enough, also resting after triggering some events or quests leads to automatic resolution (quite disappointing) of those events. So it feels that whatever you do - you are going to miss some story. An awful feeling for a story-driven game.\n\n[*]\"Entering a different region\". Sometimes the game forces a long rest if you travel to a different region, other times it doesn't. Sometimes prominent quests in the current region are going to automatically resolve in detrimental ways if you travel to a different region, sometimes they won't. There is no consistency or clarity. It negatively impacts exploration in a game, where exploration is supposed to be a big part.\n\n[*]Tons of useless containers and loot. If you worry that you might miss some useful loot - you have reasons for that. And that also means that you are going to spend hours of your time going through useless jars or boxes. It doesn't add to the game, just wastes your time. My advice - just use a guide listing all the notable loot and then ignore the rest. But that is not a good sign for a game. And if you need gold - just pickpocket vendors.\n\n[*]Approval system. If you do not have enough approval from your companions, at certain points of their story they might just leave. Or you might be forced to kill them. Or they would make a choice affecting the story in regrettable ways. So you want to get their approval. So you spend hours swapping your companions for each dialogue, as only those in your active party have a chance to get approvals during you questing. Again, following a guide is very useful here. And again, it is a bad sign for any game.\n\n[*] Honor mode. Honor mode is not just an ironman. It is also an increase in difficulty, as some mechanics change. And because bosses get new abilities. So you have a mode that doesn't provide much room for error. And when you come to a boss you see the boss having an unexpected new ability that you were not able to prepare for (unless you, you know, follow guides instead of playing the game), which might result in a loss of dozens of hours of your play time. And do not forget the bugs that might just screw your run. If you want the achievement - just follow some speed running guides. That might allow you to beat the game in an hour or two.\n\n[*]Unable to go to camp. End of both act 2 and of act 3 you lose the access to your camp. Which means no long resting, so no chance to restore spell slots etc, but also means you can't switch party members. End of act 3 throws meat waves of enemies at you and you can't risk using your abilities, as you do not know when you are going to really need them later. And end of act 2 I had no idea that it was the moment [spoiler]Gale[/spoiler] was getting ready to, so I didn't even have him in my party.\n\n[*][spoiler]Jaheira[/spoiler] end of act 2. When I finally got a chance to invite into my party a certain prominent druid lady, I had no idea that a) there was going to be another chance to invite her and that b) inviting her end of act 2 means being stuck with her through the rest of act 2. She can't be told to stay at the camp and at the same time she doesn't have any special interactions through the act 2 finale.

For me, both those control modes are big time immersion destroyers. Constantly manipulating a floating camera to try to figure out where you are, where you are going, and what's going on around you is unnatural and often disorienting, as apposed to simply looking around yourself in the first person perspective like you do naturally (whether its true first person, through your own eyes; or third/first person over your shoulder.)  And turn based combat, as opposed to real time, is just plain tedious.\n\nOkay, so admittedly that's more a critique of click-to-move with turn-based combat games in general than it is of Baldur's Gate 3 specifically. The game environment is gorgeous.  The character creation, character races, character sub-races and sub-classes give you endless options and is a lot of fun just to browse through. The game is pleasingly narrated where appropriate and the cut scenes seem to be well paced. Finally, the nod to classic D20 D&D is kind of cute and fun.\n\nEn fin; I'm disappointed because this game simply is not going to engender the kind of addictive immersion I look for in an RPG, but it's still worth playing on a more casual level.\n\n\nEdit - \n\nNow six and a half hours into the game and I'm requesting a refund from Steam. I tried hard, wanted to like it, but the reality is I'm spending more time trying to wrestle the camera into submission than I am enjoying the game. And to add insult to injury the turn based combat just feels like it's running slow as molasses, both issues together make the game simply aggravating.

Not had any game breaking issues and any bugs I have experienced have been extremely minor - mostly character getting stuck in weird places or angles of the camera - but more user issues than game issues I feel.\n\nDefinitely recommend this experience\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1706180757, "timestamp_updated": 1706180757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500290751457214355", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156771210": {"recommendationid": "156771210", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985857803", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 45953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45953, "last_played": 1705667672}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely detailed game world and engaging story with huge potential for replayability.

And I just don't have 200 hours to sink into an 80 GB RPG at my age.  I enjoyed Divinity: Original Sin and couch co-op'd with my wife in D:OS 2, but we have a mortgage and a dog and no time.\n\nThen I read the Tweet.  You know the one: the prominent game developer who said that we cannot allow Larian to define our expectations of RPGs.  Oh, really?  I immediately bought the game and spent hours downloading it out of pure, unadulterated spite.\n\nI am 3 hours in.  Three.  I am blown away.  I spent the first hour creating my character.  I pulled out my Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition Player's Handbook and marveled at what BG3 had enabled me to do - this is the full blown 5E character creation.  The maniacs at Larian  took Divinity: Original Sin and made it into D&D 5E, full stop.  Amazing.\n\nAnd then I played for a couple of hours.\n\nI haven't fallen in love with a game like this since Dragon Age: Origins and there is so much more depth to BG3 in the short time I've played.  Case in point: I found a lockpick, broke into a crypt, looted a burial site and was promptly incinerated by a flame trap over a greased floor.  Thank you, Larian, for reminding me of the F5 key.\n\nThe graphics are amazing.  The voice work is the best.  The cut scenes are riveting and that's usually when I go make another whisky!  The sound design is unbelievable.  Why am I noticing sound design?  I don't care about sound design!\n\nI've misclicked so many times.  There's so much to click!  I've died in so many ways.  There are so many ways to die!  There are so many bugs, but I don't even care because in a game as complex and deep as this, you're going to experience lots and lots of FUN. \n\nLarian, you've done it.  You've made a game so incredible that other developers are banding together to warn us not to play your magnum opus or we won't enjoy the next Stranger Things Click Quest game or whatever garbage they're shoveling out.  \n\nI cannot wait to spend days in Baldur's Gate 3.\n\n\n* Edit 8/1/2023 after ~60 hours *\n\nSince this review got some attention, let me give you an update after about 60 hours of Early Access.  My initial review is, obviously, hyperbolic, but that was my real-time reaction to finding a truly great game in a genre and style that I thought had been abandoned by game producers who are more interested in games as service, micro-transactions and shooters.\n\nThe best review of BG3 I could give is that this is the game I've been hoping for since Dragon Age: Origins.  I play games for systems, not so much story, and I really like both the systems and the story of this game.  If I really like a game, I look forward to starting over and trying something new (I play XCOM 2 and Dwarf Fortress a little bit.)

If you want to check it out I put a link at the end of this review. I know a lot of people found this initial review helpful and I hope my most recent one can help people decide whether or not they want to buy the game! \n\nSo should you get Baldur's Gate 3? If you really like Larian RPG games then probably yeah, it's a lot like their other games with a few major differences that might make you not enjoy the game: \n\n1) The skills don't have CDs like in other games, they're based on 5E D&D so they're based on your class, so your class selection is very important and you'll need a balanced party.\n\n2) If you're big into D&D games like me you might be frustrated at some of the Larian game mechanics, like Ray of Frost leaving ice beneath the feet of enemies and similar spells leaving fields on the ground that debuff or damage targets. Ray of Frost is the biggest offender since slipping on ice ends your turn, or your opponents turn making it the best mage cantrip for its RNG value. \n\nIs this game a sequel to Baldur's Gate 1 and 2? \n\nNo, so far it seems like it has nothing to do with the other Baldur's Gates game besides the fact you're trying to get to Baldur's Gate to some degree but can't because monsters are fucking around in the countryside, as per usual. Your character is also not a Bhaalspawn so I'm not sure why they called it Baldur's Gate 3 when more accurately it should be like: Baldur's Gate: The Mind Flayering or something similar. \n\nDoes the game run well? \n\nDepends on your machine, mine is fairly powerful and with the game ready Nvidia Driver the game runs smooth, however textures kinda pop in weirdly, the game is in Early Access so it's expected that the graphics aren't full up to snuff yet. \n\nDoes the combat feel good? \n\nYeah, it feels pretty good they got the 5E stuff in game to work really well and they added in special weapon attacks that make a big difference. The Combat is deadly, but fair and you have loads of options to subvert encounters and crush your enemies. Beyond that it's not a big murder hobo affair either you do murder many things but I was surprised when I actually found some friendly monsters who'd normally be murder hobo fodder. Larian also wisely shot the alignment system of D&D in the head behind a shed which was a good move since 5E doesn't really use that system very much anyways. I find the AI however has a hard time handling stealth attacks, where I can sometimes get three free stealth attacks against monsters if I have my rogue hidden well, perhaps that's a bug or a reward for good positioning I can't say. \n\nHow is the Story? (Don't worry, no spoilers)\n\nStory is pretty fine and the characters you meet along the way are interesting. Some are a bit hostile towards you but due to the situation you find yourself in I think it's 100% natural that your party will be distrustful towards each other and your character. However I found that even the more nasty characters do warm up to you quickly, or at the very least treat you as a decent person. I read some reviews after playing where reviewers complained that the party ALWAYS hated you. But I only ever felt that one NPC hated me, and now after a few hours into the game they talk to me as an ally and have even confided into me about some of their own secrets making me feel like it's something that could easily become a true friendship. One praise I'll give it that others will call negative is that some persuasion options might not be good ideas. Please use your common sense, you might not want to tell sensitive things about your situation to certain people or even if you pass your check it might have a negative outcome, in this case passing the check makes a really bad situation a bit less bad. You also get special dialogue options due to some special magical powers you get rather early on in the game though I'll avoid calling them by name because that could be a spoiler which give you OP persuasion options that you cannot fail, however I like that the game implies that by using these powers you can get some negative backlash, these options even let you learn extra details about certain characters that share your condition though I have opted not to use them since I assume it will worsen my relationship with the character. The only downside of conversations is that in single player you can't change who is talking to perform skill checks. I had a Dex check in a conversation to pick a lock but couldn't let the rogue do his job to pick the lock. There was also lacking a dialogue option of me just using the key I had on me to unlock the shackles the guy was trapped in. The animations in conversation are also fairly stiff looking and your character only has a few stances they take, they're kinda annoying and I hope they add more variety to them. \n\nSo how good is the game in Early Access? \n\nI'd say pretty good, you get a large area to explore and the characters are varied and the story interesting if a bit high fantasy, though I feel Baldur's Gate was also High Fantasy, I will say I'm not a fan of certain named characters existing in the world like Volo who I found, but I was happy to learn you can also mindlessly murder such refferences and rob their dead caracasses with only minimal consequences (I bribed a guard like 200 gold after I killed Volo and stole all of his swag, it was super worth I'd recommend murdering Volo in every game he's in.)  Beyond that I'd say the game is on the right track to be a cool RPG, though the game requires patience if you want to avoid murder hoboing, the game gives most characters even goblins actual names which makes talking to them and learning their secrets worthwhile, I'd recommend talking to as many people as your patience can handle to solve problems non-violently since some fights are nearly unwinnable. Also don't forget to scout around with your rogue to find shenanigans to cheese encounters and make sure you're not about to walk into a hornets nest.\n\nPatch 8 Review: https://youtu.be/aukz9SodB44", "timestamp_created": 1603127507, "timestamp_updated": 1663033488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 714, "votes_funny": 25, "weighted_vote_score": "0.955706179141998291", "comment_count": 25, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153717941": {"recommendationid": "153717941", "author": {"steamid": "76561199120287573", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1242, "playtime_at_review": 954, "last_played": 1707775892}, "language": "english", "review": "Im not a gamer, but i like this game, i can play on easy mode and just relax and have fun :)", "timestamp_created": 1702737490, "timestamp_updated": 1702737490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1966, "votes_funny": 45, "weighted_vote_score": "0.955020308494567871", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143657075": {"recommendationid": "143657075", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146129341", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 54769, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2295, "last_played": 1697484377}, "language": "english", "review": "Baldur's Gate 3 is a reminder of what the Golden Age of gaming used to be like. \nNo microtransactions, no season pass, no subscription, no content-cut DLC. \n\nWhat you buy is what you get, and what you get is the best cRPG and one of the best RPG's ever created.\n\nI'm buying this game on GOG too, just to support Larian.

One of the best CRPGs of all time, perhaps the best mainstream CRPG ever made. My playtime is real (minus the 12 hours I spent in EA), so you can see the game is HUGE. And all that playtime is filled to the brim with well-executed content.\n\nSo if you like RPGs, tactics, huge adventures, and bears, the game is a must-buy. It's not a question. The only real question is: is [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] a 97/100?\n\nShort answer: Act 1 absolutely is. And Act 1 took me 56 hours. If the game [b]only[/b] consisted of Act 1 with some sort of ending, it would already have been brilliant. Think about it: less than one third of [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] is already a better game than most other CRPGs on the market. How is it even possible?\n\nLater, however, it starts to crumble under its own weight \u2014 and I don't just mean the bugs. Those will be fixed; the meaninglessness of many final choices and lack of companion interaction likely won't. \n\nAnd it's a damn shame.\n\n[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]\nLarian RPGs aren't simply RPGs, they border isometric immersive sims, and it's a great concept, brilliantly executed here. You have your ordinary RPG fare: classes, abilities, XP, lockpicking, traps. And then you have a simulated world that you can interact with in creative and sensible ways. Can't pick a chest? Just take it away to open in camp. A boss is too tough? Surround him with explosive barrels pre-encounter and blow to smithereens. Or befriend him \u2014 you can side and kill any faction in the game. Can't reach someplace? Aside from various teleportation spells, you can also just carry a bunch of boxes to build a tower wherever you need.\n\nTraversal is a separate \u2014\u00a0and unique \u2014 feature of the game. Most CRPGs are flat, apart from terrain in some battlefields, sometimes. Larian uses the Z axis to its full extent. [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] has interesting jumping puzzles (what right does a CRPG even have to have those?). Some of its areas, like the Monastery, feel like legacy dungeons from a FromSoft game, and I mean it in the best way possible. They're [b]fun[/b] to explore and find routes through, secrets in. It's a game as much about exploration as it is about story and combat.\n\n(Not to mention that it uses verticality for spectacular visual impressions in some areas.)\n\nAnother critical aspect of [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i]'s exploration is just how dense it is. Even the emptier areas are [i]packed[/i] with content. You find characters, secrets, reactivity, small stories. Figuring out a secret sometimes requires unique interactions, like reading a scroll in a certain location or casting a specific spell. It's brilliant, and fun, and the best aspect of the game by far. \n\nNo other product on the market offers anything remotely comparable.\n\n[b]STORY[/b]\nIt's hit and miss.\n\nI'd put it this way: in this game, Acting > Characters > Story. [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] is incredibly well-acted, I can't remember a single character, even minor, that would be presented as anything less than good, and most main characters are just charisma personified \u2014 to the point where I was disappointed I couldn't have more interactions with someone like Ketheric. So whenever a character arc struggles a bit (being too cliche or too melodramatic), the acting makes up for it. And since most characters are interesting enough, their personal stories make up for the less brilliant part of the overall narrative. So in the end, it works. \n\nWriting has never been Larian's strongest suit. Since you can befriend or kill any character in the game, their writing in Divinity tended to be skin-deep \u2014\u00a0and it's definitely MUCH better here. So that's progress.\n\nThe tone of [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] would probably not be for everyone. It rarely takes itself too seriously \u2014\u00a0and it's at its best when it doesn't. The small comedic storylets (like with the smart orge) and characters (like Minsc) just ooze charm. The erotic scenes are honesly very cool \u2014 if, again, you don't take yourself too seriously. With many of them, you're not meant to.\n\nIt's also very black-and-white, almost outdated in this regard. You can absolutely have an evil playthrough, but do understand that \"evil\" means \"cackling sadistic evil that enjoys splattering squirrels and forcing people to kill themselves with their own daggers in front of you.\" Good and evil are objective qualities here \u2014\u00a0and there is no grey area, no attempt at deconstruction. It's all fun if you go with it; just keep it in mind.\n\nThe game's pacing is also great. You need to rest from time to time, usually after harder fights. And most long rests launch cutscenes that explore one story or another: of your party members, weird urges, or mysterious Guardian. Companions also have a LOT of reactivity and interjections in random events. It's all mixed up to create a very natufal flow. I don't think a lot of players even notice it \u2014 rare occasions of unique reactivily (like characters having reactions to having been killed and resurrected by you) are flashier. But don't underrate the importance of overall pacing. Pacing can make or break a game.\n\n[b]SO WHAT IS WRONG HERE?[/b]\nAct 1 is absolutely brilliant and one of the best games I've ever played.\n\nAct 2 makes some odd choices, but at least they're clearly artistic. After a dense location filled to the brim with content and reactivity, you find yourself in a huge open area with trash mob ambushes. I appreciate the Bloodborne-esque aesthetics as much as the next gal, but why does the game willingly forefit its best assets: the interesting secret-packed exploration, the reactivity, the interlocking events, the verticality?\n\nHint for future players: defy your natural instincts and follow the main story in Act 2 instead of exploring everything before getting to it. It'll send you off to explore anyway, but in a more fun way.\n\nAct 3 is... huge. It's probably bigger than Acts 1 and 2 combined \u2014 which makes sense, you expect the city to be lively. And the stories are still all right in theory, but \u2014 well, half of them just don't deliver. \n\nThe game fails to fulfill its ambitions.\n\nYou can side with [spoiler]Gortash[/spoiler] and his sensible evil proposal \u2014\u00a0except all you get is the inability to finish some companion quests and discover perhaps the biggest twist in the story, you can't get a \"normal evil ruler\" ending. That deal with the devil you made? A short cutscene in the end and nothing more. [spoiler]A non-illithid can't control the Netherbrain[/spoiler], except if you make a treacherous choice in the final cutscene, where you suddenly totally can. It feels good to gather allies for the final battle, but each of them only utters a single phrase \u2014 less than random characters in the street!\n\nGenerally speaking, siding with evil never feels like an equal choice past Act 1. It feels like a way to skip a boss fight. You're never rewarded by content for it.\n\nYou can't even discuss the final events with my whole party \u2014 only the three characters you took with you! How does that make any sense! Not to mention that companions have little to say over the course of the whole act, and there are zero to none unique interactions between them (like the conflict between Lae'zel and Shadowheart in Act 1) \u2014\u00a0and this is in the part of the story where I want their insights the most, to see how they've changed.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the final conflict is still... all right. It offers no surprises and has too many moving parts, and your mysterious Guardian plays a role too technical and not compelling enough. And you're very much railroaded into the good ending. But it's still interesting and epic compared to other games.\n\nIt's just that my expectations were set much higher. Because Act 1 was so brilliant.\n\n[b]CONCLUSION[/b]\nStill one of the best CRPGs ever. Buy it. Play it.\n\nJust temper the expectations Act 1 sets.

I didn't know until later that the NES had helped to revive the gaming industry after a crash.\n\nMy favorite way to play video games became computer gaming in the late 1990s, with the release of games like Baldur's Gate, Ultima Online, Diablo 2, and Counter-Strike. These games were all so different from each other, but they all offered something special. Baldur's Gate had an incredible story and game-changing actions. Ultima Online was a massively multiplayer sandbox that gave gamers the freedom to do whatever they wanted. Diablo 2 had an excellent atmosphere and fast-paced ARPG action. And Counter-Strike had fast-paced action and perfected shooting mechanics as an online shooter.\n\nOver the years, I've played many other great games that have pushed the gaming industry forward. These include System Shock, Deus Ex, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild, Final Fantasy VIII and IX, the Half-Life series, Portal, Left 4 Dead, Elden Ring, Bioshock, and The Last of Us. All games crafted perfectly and created with so much love and talent.\n\nHowever, I've noticed that I've enjoyed fewer and fewer new games over time. I used to think that this was just a sign of getting older, but I realized that the problem was with the gaming industry itself. Most AAA titles now offer the same tired systems and graphics. The focus on realism has made games feel systematic & slightly lifeless as well as almost all games having some type of monetization system that just automatically makes the experience feel cheap and unmotivating. What happened to using your abilities and time to get the items that you want?\n\nBy 2023, I was basically only playing older games. They still offered a unique experience that I couldn't find in modern games. They didn't have monetized systems or focus on the realism that became so lifeless and cold. They were just well-crafted games that were made with a lot of labor and love by developers that wanted to make a great title just because they loved this industry just as much as I did.\n\nThen I played Baldur's Gate 3. It was everything I had been looking for in a modern game. It was polished, true to the original Baldur's Gate, and free of monetization. It was a return to the old days when games were crafted to be amazing and had an experience that\u2014once you purchase the title, once\u2014were all available for you to explore just depending how you wanted to play the game. There are over hundreds of hours of cutscenes and it would most likely take thousands of hours and multiple play throughs to find everything this game has to offer. Each and every character feels like a completely unique being in the game, with their own voice-acted lines that they say, creating this world that feels so alive. Basically your play through will be unique to you and your character.  The combat\u2014while turn based\u2014still feels fast and exciting and open up's possibilities for you to brainstorm new ways to eliminate your foe. Your environment plays a big part on how you solve a battle. Hope you're not standing in water while fighting a mage with a lightning spell. And unlike a lot of modern RPG's, your actions absolutely have an effect on this world and the people that live in it. Even wearing specific items can affect those around you based on their beliefs or their relationship to you. And it's all done so well that it feels like a living and breathing world.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 did something different in the face of an industry that at times feels stagnant and same-y. Larian made a courageous game for gamers, as gamers. Baldur's Gate 3 is truly the pinnacle of gaming and I only hope  AAA studio's find this as a reminder of what games can truly be.\n\nAs of 2023, I realized that I wasn't growing out of touch with the gaming industry. The gaming industry was growing out of touch with itself. Baldur's Gate 3 is a beacon of light in a foggy and ambiguous time in gaming. The quality and care put into BG3 is what I thought most games would have strived to be in the year 2023.\n\nIf you're feeling like I do and you're tired of the gaming industry's monetization pitfalls and careless development, I highly recommend picking up Baldur's Gate 3. It's the type of game that made me fall in love with this industry all those years ago.\n\n**edit** I should clear up that the playtime here on Steam does not reflect my overall playtime in BG3.

So I would change the \"MIGHT\" for a \"MOST LIKELY\". \n\nThe replayability is top tier. There is so much content to be explored that on my most recent run I still found at least 3-4 entirely new cutscenes and interactions. \n\nThe playability is also top tier. While it might be hard to get into for people not used to D&D or Turn-Based RPGs, the combat is simple enough as long as you're willing to read spells or simply click stuff and see what happens. In explore difficulty this is specially true since combat is a lot more forgiving and you can get away with the most basic spells without having to play optimally or tactically even and simply enjoy the adventure.\n\nThe story is so well developed that it got me really into Forgotten Realms just to learn more about this universe that I hadn't truly explored before.

So again they tend to dislike the game because it's so unfamiliar to them, Narratively and Mechanically.\n\n[b] As a D&D 5e DM and Player [/b] I find BG3 to be [b]great[/b]. It has alot of the core features in it, and from what i hear Larian plans to have all or at least as close to all of them as possible at launch. Which is awesome. From the Player perspective, it's so refreshing to just be able to boot up a game and play a D&D 5e campaign without having to schedule meetings with others and run a 7 hour session. Don't get me wrong I still do that, but it's so cool to have that experience without all the effort that you have to go through in real life lol.\n\n[b] From a Videogame perspective[/b], BG3 is also [b] great[/b]. The RPG elements are so well defined, Combat is fluid and takes pace just as if you were using Roll20 or Pen and Paper (well it's quite faster since you don't have multiple people thinking over what to do). Animations and Graphics are wonderful to look at. And the narrative it's delivered in such a cinematic way. Also something to note, Combat can be very difficult, because most of the enemies you see even if they are taken from the D&D lore are alot more powerful than in D&D, like, you see goblins casting Bless and using Action Surge n stuff, which made me laugh. Goblins are scary here.\n\nEven in early accsess, BG3 can give you 30 to 40 hours of gameplay PER CHARACTER you make, that's if you'd like to try more than one class, and you probably will. And though content will be the same, there are multiple ways of dealing with the same situations you face, wich is something not many games offer.\n\nThe game does have it's bugs here and there, but nothing gamebreaking. And the game still has plenty of room to improve, we'll see where Larian takes this game to, but it's looking good so far.\n\n[B] Definetly get this game at launch, and if you can spare the cash and can't wait, get it now, you won't regret it either way.

Being an edgy teenager and roleplaying as an evil edgy half-elf wizard, I obviously agreed, so we got to doing a little magicicide and kept going our way, cleared the tower, finished the game a long while after, and that was that.\n\nI enjoyed the game so much I started a new playthrough, got to the mage's tower and found this group again, but this time I decided to help them instead of giving them a ticket to the afterlife and, to my surprise, it turned out one of the mages, an old woman, could become one of your companions. She had tons of dialogue, a personal quest, a personal story to tell, [b]and the game allowed me to miss this completely[/b] My decision of being an edgelord and slaughtering a bunch of mages caused me to miss a possible companion, and the game was full of situations when your actions would impact your character and the world around you. One of my companions left my party near the end of the game because I spared a guy he hated. In one playthrough, I'd ally myself with a group werewolves and kill a settlement elves so I could have them in my army for the final fight, in the other I'd help the elves cleanse the werewolves of their curse, losing them as allies but befriending the elves. You could help people in distress or make matters worse, and the world would continue on, and this was true for the whole game.\n\nI searched a long time for a game that could give me that same feeling, of being in a world that doesn't give you the \"right\" or \"wrong\" path, but simply choices and consequences, but none would do it. Not the other Dragon Age games, nor Mass Effect, nor The Witcher, nor thePathfinder games, and I eventually gave up, thinking that I was seeing DAO through rose-tinted glasses, the special feeling I had being no more than nostalgia.\n\nTen years or so from that, I played Baldur's Gate 3, and I finally felt I was playing DAO for the first time all over again.\n\nThis game accounts for everything, and I mean [b]everything[/b]. Every single conflict can be solved in a multitude of ways. Whether you play the hero or the villain, the ways in which you can act can vary depending on how you got to the place, your character`s class, your race, your past actions, your companions, your character skills. And it doesn't matter what you decide to do, the game keeps going, the world changes to fit the consequences of your actions, the biggest example of this being that [spoiler] you can side with the goblins who are attacking the druid` grove, the first settlemet full of friendly npcs you find, and the game will carry on, with a completely different scenes after that, your companions reacting accordingly to the atrocity you made them commit and the main quest will continue despite destroying what seemed to be your best chance of survival at the moment. And you can miss this entirely. [/spoiler]\n\nBeing in early access, I can't talk much about the story, but what we have so far is really promising. Each companion is wonderfully voiced acted, and they all have interesting backstories and quests that you may only get to see if they approve of you enough.\n\nCombat feels amazing even though it can be a little slow at times, being turn-based and lacking RTWP as an option. Every hit carries a lot of weight, and most of the spells look and sound incredible. Larian's done a pretty good job at adapting the D&D 5e rules to a video game format. Also, the music is fantastic overall.\n\nRight now, the full game is two months from being released, and I'm hoping the finished product has the same level of quality the early access has shown.

I was hands on with scripting quests, enemy encounters, setting up 'cinematics', creating items, spells, monsters, placing them and so on. I\u2019m not sure how best to review BG3 in Early Access, and I\u2019m trying to keep in mind the full release is at least a year away. I also feel like I've been in enough EA/Betas to realize some things won't change much from how they are now. I mention working on the originals so you\u2019re aware I have some bias with the series (Believe me, it\u2019s not worth mentioning to put up with trolls and insults otherwise). \n\n(Designer Mindset): Is me trying to comment from a designer standpoint more than a gamer. If you announce something as BG3, I have certain expectations. Otherwise, BG: <Insert Subtitle Name> would have been preferred. But the choice to include \u201c3\u201d means something to me, so I'll treat it as such.\n\nInitial Impressions:  It feels like an updated new Divinity Game using the ruleset of D&D 5E.  It's not a BAD thing, but it doesn't feel like 'Baldur's Gate' to me. Pathfinder: Kingmaker and Pillars of Eternity feel more similar to what I'd expect.\n\n(Designer Mindset):  Some of the big keys to Baldur's Gate were unspoken but always there, including trying to include a great story, memorable characters, quests, many choices in how you portray your character and approach things, and a mix of real-time w/ pause D&D combat. The lack of a real-time combat component has thrown me off from feeling like this is supposed to be a sequel. It was a defining part of BG at the time, whether or not you like the feature.\n\nCharacter Creation:  EA allows 6 classes currently. I love the many options of backgrounds, classes and races. There are a lot of choices available, with a lot more to come which is great. I hope there\u2019s eventually more variety in faces/hair personally.\n\n(Update/Designer Mindset): I was concerned that enemies may not have variety and were limited to these 6 classes as well. This does not appear to be the case with EA which is good. It still feels a little strange to me that they haven\u2019t tried to include most of the classes already. Not sure if it was an EA decision or if they just aren\u2019t fully ready yet. \n\nGameplay:  It feels like Divinity but switching in D&D 5E Stats, Abilities, Skills, Spells, Monsters and so on.  Again, it's not a BAD thing, and it's enjoyable, but it feels like I'm playing a new Divinity Game set in Forgotten Realms.  \n\n(Update/Designer Mindset):  This one is still difficult for me. I\u2019m not here to argue turn based vs. real time, I\u2019m just saying what it is and how the gameplay feels. I personally enjoy both styles, but it's not what I'd expect from a game labeled as a Baldur\u2019s Gate sequel. The fact is it feels like Divinity more than other CRPGs and that\u2019s that.\n\nCompanions: So far there are 5 companions available, most likely one of which you will NEVER use. Party size is limited to 4, and you probably won't want to double up with your own protagonist's choice in class. Initial impressions are there are a lot of angry, bossy people in this world.\n\n(Update/Designer Mindset): Again, not arguing if it\u2019s a good or bad thing, but it\u2019s noticeable at the moment how they\u2019re portrayed. It constantly feels like my party is disappointed in my actions if I try to help people, and I\u2019ve only played a few hours into the game. I have no other choices of who to bring along, so yes it\u2019s a little frustrating. \n\nPathfinder: Kingmaker offered someone cheerful, some morally questionable, some valorous choices and so on near the beginning.  So far it feels as though everyone is out for themselves, and it's a bit hard to like them as a result.They are more memorable for something afflicting them (vampirism, time bomb, anger, etc.) than a personality. This might change over time of course, but that\u2019s my initial impression.\n\nA big part of what made things memorable for BG was the choices between many of your companions, learning about them and their personalities and having a lot of options for party make ups. Choice and variety were always important. Telling me they\u2019re \u201csupposed\u201d to dark doesn\u2019t help or change the fact it feels like there should be more options in classes and personalities, which I\u2019m not sure will change.\n\nTrying a different class, a companion died before I\u2019d even met them, thanks to enemies ganging up on him. It was interesting and I\u2019m glad that conversations changed due to their (and others) death. If not for another play through though, I\u2019d have completely missed out on a companion due to RNG without even knowing it, and I had no way to help them in time. I\u2019d have no choice for my party at all if I didn\u2019t want to double up on classes.\n\nSkill Rolls (Updated):  Perception checks help your party find hidden things, arcana checks can help you decipher languages you may not know, and rolls for intimidation, persuasion and so on are included in dialogue options. I\u2019m happy for this feature, as it makes me feel like those skills seem to matter here. \n\n(Designer Mindset): I do hope they pay attention and continue to make the choices matter.  Intimidating a group to run away is great but not being rewarded any XP or anything for doing so, not so much.\n\nWhy Baldur's Gate 3(?): I feel like this is the big question so far, and while I'm sure they want to maintain some mystery, I guess I don't understand the choice yet. Larian has already made some amazing popular games, and if they wanted to go down their own Forgotten Realms story I\u2019d look forward to it. Whether it's in story, gameplay, characters, interactions, choices though, it doesn't feel like there\u2019s any continuation from the original games currently. It might be there at some point, I don't know, but at this time I haven't seen it.  \n\nSo far it\u2019s Larian\u2019s take on Baldur\u2019s Gate, taking the game in their own direction. That\u2019s completely fine, but let\u2019s face it, some people were hoping to find more of a continuation of BG1&2 with a similar playstyle, and not so much a D&D version of Divinity. Whether or not you like one style of gameplay over the other isn\u2019t the point really. Reviews should give information and opinions for those still deciding if they should spend money on this game. \n\nVerdict: Do I think the game is worth recommending?  Yes.  Do I think those that expect more of an original Baldur\u2019s Gate like experience, and not something similar to Divinity, would be disappointed? At this time, Yes. Saying the game play is better for you doesn\u2019t change the fact that it is what it is. Some will love it and some will be disappointed, while others don\u2019t mind either way. You should all make up your own mind at the end of the day and enjoy the games you like. \n\nI enjoy the gameplay and combat, but if I\u2019m honest, I was hoping for more of a change from how it feels from Divinity. I can look past it, but I know others won\u2019t, or don\u2019t want to. Even with D&D rules, stats, spells and naming conventions, I barely notice a difference truthfully.\n\nThe story is interesting to me and I'm excited to see where it goes. The companions, while annoying, still feel unique, not generic and there\u2019s enough there that I do want to learn more about them. Spells and monsters look and act as expected from D&D 5E. There are some bugs, and the game does need polish but it\u2019s still very playable and enjoyable in Early Access. If you want a full feature game though, with all the quests, classes and balance, I'd highly recommend you try to wait. \n\nI know when it\u2019s finished it will be an enjoyable and well received game. In its current form, it is more alike to Divinity in spirit than to Baldur\u2019s Gate though in my opinion. So I struggle to feel as though it\u2019s a sequel to Baldur\u2019s Gate so far other than in name and knowing the city itself will make an appearance down the road.

Together, we decided to give it a try, thinking it would be a humorous story to share with our friends.\n\nThe first time we played, it was a comedy of errors.

Each gaming session became a new adventure, filled with both in-game challenges and fits of laughter from our clumsy mistakes.\n\nAs we journeyed through the rich story and complex puzzles of \"Baldur's Gate,\" we began to work as a team, just like in the early days of our marriage. We strategized together, celebrated our victories, and consoled each other in our defeats. The game became our nightly ritual, a time where we could escape to a fantastical world and reconnect.\n\nPlaying \"Baldur's Gate\" rekindled something in our relationship that we thought we had lost. We found new topics to talk about, reminiscing about our in-game adventures during the day. Our shared interest in the game led to other shared activities, reigniting the spark that brought us together all those years ago.\n\n\"Baldur's Gate\" became more than just a game for us; it was a gateway to rediscovering each other. It showed us that no matter how long you've been together, there are always new and exciting ways to connect and grow as a couple. Our evenings in front of the computer, exploring the Sword Coast, became cherished moments, a testament to the enduring power of love and laughter.", "timestamp_created": 1704739354, "timestamp_updated": 1704739354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2794, "votes_funny": 130, "weighted_vote_score": "0.929278016090393066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139511585": {"recommendationid": "139511585", "author": {"steamid": "76561199095565088", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 17279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1037, "last_played": 1705434138}, "language": "english", "review": "I used a child as a weapon", "timestamp_created": 1685841168, "timestamp_updated": 1701039959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 934, "votes_funny": 669, "weighted_vote_score": "0.929015457630157471", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144227682": {"recommendationid": "144227682", "author": {"steamid": "76561199234667780", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 108839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 832, "playtime_at_review": 6251, "last_played": 1707764724}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't felt this type of escapism & happiness since my early days of gaming (around age 10).

You don't know how you got here, but you're here. And you start walking around the dump and looking around. On the right you see Blizzard - with a bunch of microtransactions, mobile games and promises not kept. On the left you see Bethesda, asking you to buy Skyrim once again, because they can't do anything good anymore, only to sell what everyone is already sick of. Oh yeah, don't forget EA. So you see all this shit around you and suddenly you stumble upon a mountain. At the top of that mountain, you see a light, it's calling you. You roll the critical success dice and you start climbing, a year, two, three, you climb amongst all this garbage that the game industry has become, where one game a year is really good, amongst a bunch of other crap, full of mediocre games called TRIPLE A PROJECTS.  And then after 6 years, you get to the top of that mountain and you see it.... Baldur's Gate 3. \n\nThat's how I see the gaming industry all these years later. Greedy to the point of insanity, they sell crappy games with lots of microtransactions just to get more money from us, the players. Huge companies with millions of dollars can't make good games, where you can feel like a player again, not a cash cow, with which you need to buy thousands and thousands of in-game things in addition to the game. \n\nI think Baldur's Gate 3 is not just a game, but a wake-up call for us gamers to realize where are the good companies that make games for us and where are the toxic triple A projects that are just trying to take our money from us as soon as possible while feeding us some mediocre games \"Like Assassin's Creed series from Ubisoft, that became complete garbage by the end.\" \n\nI can go on and on, but why write something, that most of us already know? It's time to stop feeding all this shit companies and support real ones, like Larian Studios, that year after year provide us only masterpieces, like Divinity before and Baldur's Gates now. They do it for us, guys, let's not fail them and give this game as much praise as possible. Maybe this will wake up most of the companies and they can see what a real game should look like. \n\nP.S. Don't get me wrong. I know there is many good games as well, companies that try too, indie companies (are my favourite ones, because they do the game from heart and soul), but let's be honest. Most of the games we see lately is pure garbage just to make money from us. Time to wake up guys. \n\nRegarding Baldur's Gate 3, I will say this. The moment game came out, I can't quit it. Me and my friend are playing this game maybe for 4 days already, non stop. I can't remember when I had the same addiction to the game before. Worth to play, worth to buy.
